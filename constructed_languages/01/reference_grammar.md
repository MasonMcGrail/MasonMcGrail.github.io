## <a name="introduction"></a>A. Introduction <a href="#table_of_contents">^</a>

This is a reference grammar for Ekhwachi, a constructed language (conlang) that appears as the main representative of its language family in a fictional setting. I am writing this grammar to have all of the information in one place, presented in a way that, hopefully, is enjoyable and interesting to read for anyone interested in conlangs or linguistics in general. Ekhwachi is very much an ongoing project, and while the core of the grammar is stable, much of the rest is in flux. Anything marked with "(?)" needs more attention and is likely to change, and each section and subsection is currently prefixed with "A.", "A.B.", etc. while their number is unknown. Also, the lexicon is severely underdeveloped (see: nonexistent), so strings of question marks are used in place of the words in examples for now.

This work is meant to be descriptive and not pedagogical; it is meant to thoroughly show the language's structure rather than serve as a resource for a hypothetical learner. To that end, I will use technical terminology whenever it would be appropriate for a particular description, but I will avoid using more obscure terms. In terms of framework, I will just be using 'basic linguistic theory' so that this work is readable to a broad audience and will remain so for years to come.

This document is divided into (?) sections. Section A is a brief overview of the language's typology and speakers. Section A describes the phonology and the romanization used throughout this document. Sections A, A, and A cover noun morphology, verb morphology, and adjective morphology, respectively. Section A deals with pronouns. Section A discusses prepositions and particles. Section A describes numerals and classifiers. Sections A and A respectively deal with noun phrases and verb phrases. Section A discusses coordination. Section A describes relative clauses. Lastly, section A covers the lexicon, and section A contains sample texts in Ekhwachi, some original, others translations.

### <a name="goals_and_use"></a>A.B. Goals and use of the language <a href="#table_of_contents">^</a>

Ekhwachi's primary goal is naturalism. In practice, it is a personal language that I will occasionally use as a naming language. It is the first of 8 languages in its setting that I intend to flesh out, as well as my first conlang that is more than a sketch. To make it stand out from the other 7 languages, I outlined some defining features of the grammar, most of which are described in more detail in section (?). Ekhwachi was intended to be:

* Highly ergative, as well as syntactically ergative for many constructions;
* Mostly head-marking with polypersonal agreement, but not polysynthetic;
* Extremely head-initial, as well as verb-initial, in terms of basic syntax;
* Relatively easy to pronounce in terms of phonology and phonotactics;
* Mostly regular, being roughly as irregular as a language such as Japanese.

### <a name="interlinear_glosses"></a>A.B. Interlinear glosses <a href="#table_of_contents">^</a>

The interlinear glosses used for examples in this work are basically consistent with the Leipzig Glossing Rules. They will be formatted in the following way:

    Line 1: the text in the romanization for Ekhwachi (in italics)
    Line 2: the words in the above text, which may be broken up into morphemes (in italics)
    Line 3: a morpheme-by-morpheme gloss of the above text, vertically aligned with it
    Line 4: an English translation of the above text, in quotes

For example:

    ??????? ??? ????? ???
    ???????            ???    ?????         ???
    PFV:P3SG:meet:A1SG DEF.SG daughter:A2PL yesterday
    'I saw your daughter yesterday'

For clarity's sake, most of the time I will not divide the words in the second line into their constituent morphemes. When particular morphemes or words are being highlighted, they will be separated from other morphology using hyphens and vertically aligned with what they correspond to on the third line. The following draws attention to the possessive suffix in the above example:

    ??????? ??? ????? ???
    ???????            ???    ???     -??   ???
    PFV:P3SG:meet:A1SG DEF.SG daughter-A2PL yesterday
    'I saw your daughter yesterday'

Additionally, regarding the translation given in the fourth line, naturalness will be prioritized over accuracy. For instance, there is a clusivity distinction in the first person plural in Ekhwachi, but this distinction will generally be ignored in translations, which will not say 'we/us (inclusive)' or 'we/us (not including you)' except when discussing clusivity.

#### A.B.C. Additional conventions

Many sentences in Ekhwachi can be interpreted in more than one way out of context. Consider the following example:

    ????????? ??? ??? ??? ???
    ?????????              ???   ??? ???  ???
    PROG:P3PL:pick.up:A3SG spear and rock be.small
    '(He/she/it) (was/is/will be) picking up (a/some) spear(s) and (a/some) small rock(s)'

Verbs are not marked for tense, so this may refer to a past, present, or future event. Also, the gender of the person is ambiguous, and indefinite inanimate nouns may be either singular or plural. In this way, 'He was picking up a spear and small rocks' and 'She is picking up spears and a small rock' are both valid translations for the above gloss in the right context. Lastly, all of the parenthetical information in the fourth line makes it very hard to read.

There are a number of conventions used in this document that exist to make the glosses easier to read, which are listed below:

- Most of the time, verbs in the perfective aspect refer to past events, so they will be translated as being in the past tense. Verbs in the imperfective aspects will be translated as being in the present tense.
- Adjectives, which are essentially similar to stative verbs such as (?), 'to be excited' and (?), 'to be small', will be glossed without 'be' when they are being used attributively.
- Indefinite, inanimate nouns will be translated as singular when their number is ambiguous.
- Third person singular human referents of unknown gender will be variously glossed as 'he', 'she', 'him', 'her', etc. Singular 'they'/'them' will be avoided in translations for clarity.

Below is the gloss from above written using these conventions:

    ????????? ??? ??? ??? ???
    ?????????              ???   ??? ???  ???
    PROG:P3PL:pick.up:A3SG spear and rock small
    'She is picking up a spear and a small rock'

Of course, these conventions will be ignored when necessary. Events that clearly take place in the future will be translated as being in the future tense, and nouns that are clearly plural will be translated as plural. When an example is being used to demonstrate some feature of the language, it will contain all of the information that it needs to fulfill its purpose.

#### A.B.C. A note on terms for syntactic arguments

The term 'subject' is troublesome when describing highly ergative languages like Ekhwachi. In this work, I will use the term 'subject' only for intransitive subjects, and I will use the term 'agent' for transitive subjects. Often, intransitive subjects and direct objects will pattern the same way, so I will also use the term 'patient' when they do. The table below summarizes how I will use terms for syntactic roles in this work.

| Term      | Symbol | Use                                   |
| --------- | ------ | ------------------------------------- |
| 'subject' | S      | subject of an intransitive verb       |
| 'agent'   | A      | subject of a transitive verb          |
| 'object'  | O      | direct object of an intransitive verb |
| 'patient' | P      | any absolutive argument (S or O)      |

When discussing semantic roles, I will use the terms 'agentive' and 'patientive' instead.

<sup>1</sup> _The choice of the labels 'Set A' and 'Set P' is meant to evoke the 'Set A' and 'Set B' person markers in Mayan linguistics because they are similar in form and function. They were named 'A' for 'agent' and 'P' for 'patient' to be more transparent to anyone who is unfamiliar with Mayan linguistics, as well as to distance Ekhwachi from the Mayan language family._

### <a name="geographic_demographic"></a>A.B. Geographic and demographic information <a href="#table_of_contents">^</a>

Ekhwachi is a language of the (?) branch of the (?) language family. It is spoken by about 17,000 people on the island of (?), which is roughly the size of Sri Lanka. (?) is somewhat distant from other landmasses, and due to this as well the nature of the ocean currents that surround it, it has no contact with the outside world. The languages spoken there only have contact with each other, and Ekhwachi in particular has only had long-standing language contact with its closest relative, (?).

#### A.B.C. The name 'Ekhwachi'

The speakers of Ekhwachi have no unique name for their language; _ekhwachi_ is a shortening of _(?) ekhwachi_, which is broken down below.

    ??? ekhwachi
    ???    ekhwa   -chi
    DEF.SG language-A1PL.IN
    'Ekhwachi', literally 'our language'

To a standard speaker of Ekhwachi, who is monolingual and feels a sense of ownership over their language and not others, the use of the definite article and the inclusive possessive suffix together uniquely identify the language. As might be expected, when referring to the language with people outside of the speech community, the exclusive possessive suffix is used instead.

For the sake of brevity, throughout the rest of this work I will be using the term 'Ekhwachi' to refer to both the language itself and members of the ethnolinguistic group that speak it.

### <a name="overview_of_grammar"></a>A.B. Overview of typological features <a href="#table_of_contents">^</a>

This section briefly details the features of the typology of Ekhwachi that make it distinct from other languages. These include summaries of its phonology, morphology, and syntax, all of which are discussed in greater detail in later sections.

#### A.B.C. Phonology and morphophonology

Ekhwachi has 5 vowel phonemes, which consist of the cross-linguistically common set of /i/, /e/, /a/, /o/, and /u/.

Figure A. _Vowel phonemes._

There are 20 consonant phonemes in 5 places of articulation (bilabial, dental, postalveolar, palatal, and velar), which form 2 series (voiceless and voiced). All of the velars have plain and labialized versions.

Figure A. _Consonant phonemes._

Syllables in the language are maximally CVC. Word stress is generally on the last syllable of a word, though there is a set of inflectional suffixes that do not shift the stress of the word, which stays on the penultimate syllable.

There is limited sibilant harmony present throughout the language. If multiple sibilants occur root-internally, they have the same place of articulation (either all dental /s/ or all postalveolar /ʃ/, /tʃ/, or /dʒ/), and /s/ in prefixes assimilates to /ʃ/ before a root containing any postalveolars.

    ??-???    '[root with /s/](?)'
    ??-???    '[root with a postalveolar sibilant](?)'

#### A.B.C. Word classes

(?)

#### A.B.C. Morphology

Ekhwachi is a predominantly agglutinative and prefixing language, though the few inflectional suffixes that do exist are very common. Verbs are rarely bare, so they can usually be readily distinguished from other parts of speech both syntactically and morphologically.

Nouns have no inflectional morphology aside from a set of possessive suffixes. A noun's number (singular/plural) is indexed on the verb if it is a core argument, and if animate, it is also pluralized using a preceding particle. A noun's grammatical role is either indexed on the verb or indicated using prepositions.

Figure A. _Set A pronominal possessive suffixes._

Verbs inflect for aspect, mood, and voice, and they agree in person and number with their A and P arguments. The affixes for these categories are given below with the verb (?), 'to throw', translated in accordance with the glossing rules outlined in section A.B. (?). Other distinctions of aspect and mood are indicated periphrastically.

| Aspect/Mood/Voice  | Marking               | Example   | Translation               |
| ------------------ | --------------------- | --------- | ------------------------- |

| Habitual aspect    | partial reduplication | _???????_ | 'I throw it'              |
| Iterative aspect   | full reduplication    | _???????_ | 'I throw it (repeatedly)' |
| Abilitative mood   | ??-                   | _???????_ | 'I can throw it'          |
| Subjunctive mood   | ??-                   | _???????_ | 'I would throw it'        |
| Imperative mood    | ??-                   | _???????_ | 'Throw it'                |

Figure A. _Verb agreement affixes for core arguments._

Adjectives are morphologically identical to stative verbs when used predicatively, though unlike verbs, they can also be used attributively, being placed after nouns without relativizing or agreement morphology. Through zero-derivation and periphrasis, they can also be used adverbially.

Other parts of speech undergo little inflection or derivation.

#### A.B.C. Syntax

Word order in Ekhwachi is overwhelmingly head-initial as well as verb-initial. The head noun of a noun phrase precedes any adjectives, numerals, demonstratives, genitives, or relative clauses that modify it, adpositional phrases are prepositional, and verbs generally precede their arguments. The default word order is verb-object-agent (VOA) for transitive verbs and is verb-subject (VS) for intransitive verbs, though AVO and SV are also common due to topicalization.

The language is predominantly head-marking, with verbs agreeing with their A and P arguments, the heads of possessive noun phrases agreeing with their possessors, and little use of non-finite verb forms. However, other heads are unmarked, such as in adjective phrases and prepositional phrases, and dependent-marking and zero-marking strategies are used for some constructions, such as for nominal predicates.

Verb agreement patterns in Ekhwachi are uniformly ergative-absolutive.

    (A.#) ?????
          ∅  -??-  ???
          PFV-P3SG-sleep
          'He slept'

    (A.#) ???????
          ∅  -??-  ?????
          PFV-P3SG-wait:A1PL.EX
          'We waited for him'

There is no case marking, and when there are multiple explicit arguments, their roles are usually made clear through word order.

    (A.#) ????????? ??? ??? ??? ???
          ?????????            ???    ???       ???    ???

          PROG:P3SG:chase:A3SG DEF.SG tiger DEF.SG hunter(?)
          'The hunter is chasing the tiger'

Noun phrases, verb phrases, and clauses can be coordinated by the conjunction (?), 'and'.

    (A.#) ??? ??? ???
          ???   ??? ???
          blood and sweat
          'blood and sweat'

### <a name="phonology_introduction"></a>A.B. Introduction <a href="#table_of_contents">^</a>

This section is an overview of the phonology of Ekhwachi. I first describe the consonants and their allophonic variation before doing the same for vowels, then I describe stress rules and phonotactics. At the end of this section, I cover details of morphophonology, which mostly deals with one assimilatory process, and I provide some evidence for my analysis of the inventory.

While Exwachil does not have a written form, in this work it will be represented with a romanization. The romanization for phonemes will be noted in the tables of its consonant and vowel inventories. If the same symbols used to represent a phoneme in the IPA and the romanization, they are not repeated. Otherwise, the IPA symbols are on the left, and the symbols used in the romanization are on the right in angle brackets.

### <a name="consonants"></a>A.B. Consonants <a href="#table_of_contents">^</a>

The 20 consonant phonemes of Exwachil have the following places and manners of articulation.

#### A.B.C Allophonic variation in consonants

All uses of 'before' and 'after' in the descriptions below refer to segments that are immediately adjacent. For example, the second-to-last rule specifies that /aku/ would be realized as \[akʷu\], but /xinu/ would be realized as \[xinu\] and not *\[xʷinu\].

- Voiceless stops and affricates may be slightly aspirated word-initially.
- Voiced stops are fully voiced in all positions, including word-initially.
- /dʒ/ is realized as \[ʒ\] in free variation (?).
- Plain velars before rounded vowels labialize, and they do not contrast with phonemically labialized velars in this position. For example, /ko/ is realized as \[kʷo\].
- /l/ is realized as \[ɾ\] before front vowels in free variation.

#### A.B.C. Romanization notes for consonants

- Labialization is not indicated where it is not contrastive. For example, because they do not contrast, /gu/ and /gʷu/ are both spelled as ⟨gu⟩ and not \*⟨gwu⟩.

### <a name="vowels"></a>A.B. Vowels <a href="#table_of_contents">^</a>

Exwachil has the following 5 vowel phonemes.

</table>

Figure A. _Vowel phonemes._

#### A.B.C. Allophonic variation in vowels

Open-mid /e/ and /o/ and their close-mid counterparts /ɛ/ and /ɔ/ are in complementary distribution.

- The vowel /e ~ ɛ/ is pronounced as \[e\] in stressed syllables, but not after /j/. After /j/ and in unstressed syllables, it is pronounced as \[e ~ ɛ\] in free variation.
- The vowel /o ~ ɔ/ is pronounced as \[o\] in stressed syllables and as \[o ~ ɔ\] in unstressed syllables in free variation.

#### A.B.C. Romanization notes for vowels

- Unstressed /e ~ ɛ/ and /o ~ ɔ/ will be respectively romanized as ⟨e⟩ and ⟨o⟩, and those symbols will also be used in broad transcription.

### <a name="word_stress"></a>A.B. Word stress <a href="#table_of_contents">^</a>

Stress in Ekhwachi is not lexically phonemic. Primary stress falls on the last syllable of the stem of almost(?) all words, and secondary stress falls on every alternate syllable such that one with primary stress is never adjacent to one with secondary stress. Stressed and unstressed syllables have roughly the same length and volume, with the greatest difference between them being pitch.

Set A markers do not attract stress, which stays on the last syllable of the stem. In practice, this means that almost(?) all words without Set A markers have primary stress on the ultimate syllable, and those with Set A markers have it on either the penultimate or antepenultimate syllable. In this way, stress is technically contrastive, as there are minimal pairs that differ only in primary stress placement, such as /??.??.ˈ??/, '\[wordA\]', and /??.ˈ??.??/, '\[wordB-A???\]' (?).

### <a name="phonotactics"></a>A.B. Phonotactics <a href="#table_of_contents">^</a>

The syllable structure of Ekhwachi is (C)V; a syllable may have any one consonant in the onset, and it must have one vowel in the nucleus. Consonant clusters do not occur, and neither vowel length nor consonant length are phonemic.

#### A.B.C. Phonotactic restrictions

In the onset of a syllable, /j/ does not occur if its nucleus is /i/. Every other sequence of segments that follows the syllable structure outlined in the previous section is permitted. 

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Onset</th>
        <th>Nucleus</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>(C)</th>
        <th>V</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>any onset other than /j/</td>
        <td>/i/</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>any onset</td>
        <td>/e/, /a/,<br>/o/, /u/</td>
    </tr>
</table>

### <a name="morphophonology"></a>A.B. Morphophonology <a href="#table_of_contents">^</a>

This section describes the assimilatory processes of the language that surface as a result of affixation and compounding. Because the limited phonotactics prevent consonant clusters, most common assimilatory processes such as nasal assimilation do not occur. The only process that can be observed in a kind of sibilant harmony that is present throughout the language.

#### A.B.C. Sibilant harmony

A well-formed root in Ekhwachi contains sibilants of only one type. They are either all dental or all postalveolar.

    ???     '[root with no sibilants]' (?)
    ???     '[root with /s/]' (?)
    ???     '[root with /ʃ/]' (?)
    *???    '[example root that is disallowed]' (?)

For all prefixes containing /s/, /s/ assimilates to /ʃ/ when attaching to stems that contain any postalveolar consonants, regardless of the number of intervening segments. Prefixes containing the postalveolars /ʃ/, /tʃ/, or /dʒ/ do not assimilate to become dental in the same way. This is possibly most commonly observed with the third person singular absolutive prefix, which has the underlying form /s(e)/.

    ??-???    '[root with no sibilants]'
    ??-???    '[root with /s/]'
    ??-???    '[root with /ʃ/]'

While there are no counterexamples of root-internal harmony in the corpus, some words contain multiple roots with sibilants and are disharmonic, such as the compound (?). For such words, prefixes assimilate to the first sibilant in the word.

    ??-???    '[compound with /s/ followed by /tʃ/]'
    ??-???    '[compound with /dʒ/ followed by /s/]'

#### A.B.C. Romanization notes

When phonemes are realized differently as a result of morphophonological processes, this change is indicated in the romanization when the phoneme's place or manner of articulation changes. In practice, this just means that the romanization will reflect sibilant harmony.

#### A.B.C. Possessive suffixes

Nouns in Ekhwachi do not inflect for most grammatical categories, including case, number, and gender. The only instance of nominal inflection is the following set of possessive suffixes, which agree in person, number, and when relevant, clusivity of the noun's possessor.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th colspan=2></th>
    <th>Singular</th>
    <th>Plural</th>

  </tr>
</table>

Figure A. _Set A pronominal possessive suffixes._

These suffixes do not attract stress, which stays on the final syllable of the stem. For suffixes that contain a segment in parentheses, that segment is only present when attaching to stems that end in open syllables.

_\[would have one or two methods (probably one) of forming intransitive verbs from nouns. Probably affixal, but it could also be done with reduplication. The example given for Tzeltal is "song" goes to "to sing", so it might be something like "do \[noun\]"\]_ (?)
-->

#### A.B.C. Compounding

Endocentric compounds consisting of a head noun and an attributive adjective are always head-initial.

    AAA-BBB    'blue heron(?)', from AAA 'heron' and BBB 'blue'
    AAA-BBB    'green parrot(?)', from AAA 'parrot' and BBB 'green'

For endocentric compounds consisting of a head and one or more modifiers, the head generally precedes any modifiers. However, there are two different kinds of endocentric noun-noun compounds, which differ in head placement. Noun-noun compounds formed by simply juxtaposing roots are head-final.

    AAA-BBB    'mountain tiger', from AAA 'mountain' and BBB 'tiger'
    AAA-BBB    'flying squirrel(?)', from AAA 'wing' and BBB 'squirrel'

Diachronically, these compounds are older and reflect a stage in the language when genitives preceded their heads, and such compounds are a closed class, with many of them synchronically analyzed as being monomorphemic due to sound changes obscuring their etymology. The other kind of noun-noun compound is head-initial, and it is formed by prosodically pronouncing a basic possessive phrase as one word.

    AAA-A3SG-BBB             'peach fuzz', from AAA 'facial hair' and BBB 'peach'
    AAA-A3SG-BBB-CCC         'barn owl', from AAA 'owl', BBB 'mask', and CCC 'white'
    AAA-A3SG-BBB-A3SG-CCC    'ant-mimicking spider', from AAA 'spider, BBB 'shape', CCC 'ant'

These have been analyzed as compounds because in terms of pronunciation and syntax, they behave as single words. In particular, the definite articles (?) and (?) normally do not occur with the heads of possessive phrases, but they occur freely with compounds.

    (A.#) ??? ???????????
          ???    ???????????
          DEF.SG owl:A3SG:mask:white
          'the barn owl'

    (A.#) * ??? ????? ??? ???
          ???    ?????    ???  ???
          DEF.SG owl:A3SG mask white
          Intended: 'the owl of a white mask', or 'the white mask's owl'

This kind of compounding is more productive, and any new noun-noun compounds are formed using it.

<!--
Noun-noun compounds where modifying noun is a nationality are also head-initial, but they do not require the possessive affixes. [some other things might not either(?)]

    AAA-BBB                   '???', from AAA '???' and BBB '???'

### <a name="verbal_template"></a>A.B. Verbal template (?) <a href="#table_of_contents">^</a>

A template for transitive verbs in Ekhwachi is given below.

    Aspect - Patient - Root - Agent/Voice

Patients are indexed on the verb using the patient slot, and suffixes are used to index agents onto the verb as well as to mark voice. Pronominal agent suffixes on verbs and possessive suffixes on nouns are formally identical.

    (A.#) ??????? ??? ?????
          ?????        -??   ???    ???    -???
          PFV:P3SG:wake-A1SG DEF.SG husband-A1SG
          'I woke up my husband'

    (A.#) ??? ??????? ???? ????¿
          ??? ?????        -??   ???    ???   -??
          Q   PFV:P3SG:find-A2SG DEF.SG mother-A2SG
          'Did you find your mother?'

### <a name="verbal_aspect"></a>A.B. Aspect <a href="#table_of_contents">^</a>

Dynamic verbs may be marked for one or more of the following five aspects: perfective, progressive, iterative, habitual, and inceptive. Morphologically, these aspects are variously marked by null, prefixes, and reduplication. Their main functions are described below.

#### A.B.C. Perfective aspect

The perfective aspect is used to refer to events that are conceived of as a bounded whole without interior composition. It is unmarked on the verb morphologically.

    (A.#) ??????? ???
          ∅-  ???????       ???
          PFV-P3SG:buy:A1SG goat(?)
          'I bought a goat'

#### A.B.C. Progressive aspect

The progressive aspect is generally used with dynamic verbs to refer to events that are incomplete, in progress, or otherwise ongoing. It is marked by the prefix (?).

    (A.#) ??????? ??? ??????? ??? ?????
          ???????       ???  ??-  ?????      ??? ?????
          P3SG:see:A1SG COMP PROG-P3PL:laugh PL  child:A3PL
          'I see their children laughing'

    (A.#) ????????? ??? ??? ???
          ??-  ???????       ???     ???    ???
          PROG-P3SG:don:A3SG robe(?) DEF.SG woman
          'The woman is putting on a robe(?)'

    (A.#) ??????? ??? ???
          ??-  ?????             ???       ???
          PROG-P3SG:cook.INTR(?) DEF.SG(?) rice(?)
          'The rice is cooking'

For verbs that refer to mental states, such as (?) 'to know' or (?) 'to like', the progressive is used to refer to being in that mental state. Using one of these verbs in the perfective aspect refers to entry into its state.

    (A.#) ??? ????????? ??? ???????¿
          ??? ??-  ???????        ???    ???????
          Q   PROG-P3SG:know:A2PL DEF.SG method(?):make:A3SG
          'Do you know how to make it?'

    (A.#) ????????? ??? ??? ??? ???
          ??-  ???????        ???    ???  ???     ???
          PROG-P3PL:like:A3SG DEF.PL bird from(?) here(?)
          'She likes the birds in this area'

    (A.#) ??????? ??? ????? ???
          ∅-  ???????           ???  ?????         ???
          PFV-P3SG:know:A1PL.EX COMP PFV:P3PL:come yesterday
          'We learned that they came yesterday'

#### A.B.C. Iterative aspect

The iterative aspect is used to denote repetitions of an event, which may be of short duration or persist for some time. It might variously be translated into English using phrases such as "repeatedly", "over and over", or "for a while", depending on the semantics of the verb. It is marked by full reduplication of the verb stem.

    (A.#) ????????, ??? ??? ????? ???
          ??  -???~???  ??? ??? ?????         ???
          P1SG-ITV~call but NEG P3SG:COP.INAN response
          'I called and called, but there was no response'
    
    (A.#) ??????? ?????
          ??  -???~???   ???
          P3SG-ITV~blink fast
          'She blinked rapidly'

This reduplication marks the iterative aspect only for telic verbs. Its other function, which is available to both telic and atelic verbs, is to intensify the verb. Whether the verb is to be read as happening multiple times or intensely is dependent on its telicity as well as context.

    (A.#) ??? ???????????? ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ????? ???
          ???       ????     -???~?????      ???  ???     ???    ???  ???    ???    ?????  ???
          yesterday PROG:P3PL-ITV~throw:A3SG rock into(?) DEF.SG lake LOC(?) DEF.SG NMZ:go this
          'Yesterday, she was throwing rocks into the lake for a while like this', or 'Yesterday, she was hurling rocks into the lake like this'
    
    (A.#) ????????
          ??  -???~???
          P3PL-ITV~be.afraid
          'They are very afraid', not *'They are afraid repeatedly'

#### A.B.C. Habitual aspect

The habitual aspect is used to refer to events that happen habitually or customarily. _\[unclear if this or the progressive aspect is more appropriate for 'living'\]_ (?). It is marked by partial reduplication of the verb stem, with the last VC sequence being reduplicated to its right. \[*-leka > *-lekeka, *-ome- > *-omome-, etc. (?)\]

    (A.#) ??????? ??? ????? ??? ??? ???
          ?????       ~??? ???    ?????       ???    ???    ???
          P3SG:wake.up~HAB DEF.SG mother:A1SG LOC(?) DEF.SG sunrise(?)
          'My mother wakes up at sunrise'

    (A.#) ???, ????????? ??? ?????
          ???          ?????                ~???-??   ???    ?????
          last.year(?) P3SG:carry.on.back(?)~HAB-A2SG DEF.SG son:A2SG
          'Last year, you would carry your son on your back'

When the subject or agent of the verb is topicalized, this aspect can be interpreted as habitual or gnomic, expressing general truths. A gnomic reading is blocked by the presence of a deictic temporal adverbial and is otherwise conditioned by context.

    (A.#) ??? ??? ???????
          ???    ???   ?????    ~???
          DEF.PL tiger P3PL:roar~HAB
          'The tigers roar', or 'Tigers roar'

    (A.#) ??? ??? ??? ???????
          ???           ???    ???   ?????    ~???
          last.month(?) DEF.PL tiger P3PL:roar~HAB
          'Last month, the tigers would roar', not *'Last month, tigers roar (as a general truth)'

#### A.B.C. Inceptive aspect

The inceptive aspect is used to refer to events that are beginning or starting. It is marked by the prefix (?). For dynamic verbs, it combines freely with the habitual and iterative aspects, but it can only combine with the progressive aspect periphrastically.

    (A.#) ??????? ??? ???
          ??- ?????    ???    ???
          INC-P3SG:run DEF.SG girl
          'The girl started to run'

    (A.#) ????????? ??? ??? ???
          ??- ???????       ??? ???    ???
          INC-P3SG:wake:HAB LOC DEF.SG dawn
          'He started waking up at dawn'

    (A.#) ??? ??????? ??? ??? ??-???????
          ???   ???????               ???    ???   ??- ???????
          after PFV:P3SG:suck(?):A1SG DEF.SG smoke INC-P1SG:ITV:cough
          'They become afraid/fearful'

    (A.#) ????????? ??? ??? ??? ???
          ?????????            ???    ??? ???    ???
          PROG:P3SG:begin:A3SG DEF.SG run DEF.SG girl
          'The girl is starting to run'

For stative verbs, it indicates entry into that state and has a meaning similar to the English "to become". More precisely, it might be said that this prefix marks both the inceptive and inchoative aspects, but I will continue to refer to its aspectual range as just 'inceptive' for simplicity. Unlike for dynamic verbs, it does not combine with other aspects.

    (A.#) ???????
          ??- ?????
          INC-P3PL:be.afraid
          'They became afraid'

    (A.#) ??? ??????? ??? ??? ???
          ??? ??- ?????        ???    ???    ???
          FUT INC-P3SG:be.easy LOC(?) DEF.SG summer
          'It will be easier in the summer'

    (A.#) ??? ??? ???????
          ???    ???     ??- ?????
          DEF.SG outside INC-P3SG:be.dark
          'It got dark outside'

### <a name="verbal_negation"></a>A.B. Negation <a href="#table_of_contents">^</a>

Verbal negation is done with the particle (?), which immediately precedes the verb and any aspect or mood particles that may be accompanying it.

    (A.#) ??? ??? ??????? ??? ????
          ???            ??? ???????              ???    ???
          fortunately(?) NEG PFV:P3PL:notice:A3SG DEF.SG shark
          'Fortunately, the shark didn't notice them'

    (A.#) ??? ????? ??? ??? ???
          ??? ?????                ???    ???  ???
          NEG PFV:P3SG:precipitate DEF.SG rain yesterday
          'It didn't rain yesterday'

In clauses containing negative indefinite pronouns, the predicate is also negated.

    (A.#) ??? ????? ??? ???
          ??? ?????       ???  ???
          NEG PFV:P3SG:go even where
          'It didn't go anywhere'

    (A.#) ??? ??? ??? ??????? ??? ?????
          ???  ??? ??? ???????             ???  ?????
          even who NEG PFV:P3SG(?):wait:AP with PL:that
          'No one waited for them'

Additionally, this particle is used to negate nominal predicates as well as adjectives.

    (A.#) ??? ??? ???
          ??? ??? ???
          yon NEG tiger
          'That over there isn't a tiger'

    (A.#) ??? ????? ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ???
          ??? ?????         ???    ???     ??? ???    ???    ???
          INC PFV:P3SG:walk DEF.SG bear(?) NEG afraid LOC(?) 1PL.EX
          'The unafraid bear started to walk towards us'

#### A.B.C. Negative imperatives

Negative imperatives, sometimes called 'prohibitives', are made differently than both negative indicative statements and affirmative imperatives. The verb is in the subjunctive mood, and the negative particle is different than in indicative statements.

    (A.#) ??? ???????!
          ??? ???- ?????
          NEG SUBJ-P2SG:go
          'Don't go!'

### <a name="predicative_adjectives"></a>A.B. Predicative adjectives <a href="#table_of_contents">^</a>

When used predicatively, adjectives are syntactically and morphologically identical to stative verbs.

    (A.#) ??? ??????? ??? ??? ??? ?????????
          ??? ???????          ???    ???   ??? ?????????

    (A.#) ??? ???????!
          ??? ???????
          NEG SBJV:2SG:be.stubborn
          'Don't be stubborn!'

### <a name="attributive_adjectives"></a>A.B. Attributive adjectives <a href="#table_of_contents">^</a>

When acting attributively, adjectives lose most verb morphology, including agreement morphology and aspect marking, and they must immediately follow the noun that they modify. However, they can be negated and intensified using the same morphology as verbs.

    (A.#) ??? ??? ???
          ??? ???   ???
          PL  woman tall
          'tall women'

    (A.#) ??? ??? ???

          'unclean water'

    (A.#) ??? ?????
          ??? ???~???

          'very hot day'

### <a name="adjectival_inflection"></a>A.B. Adjectival inflection <a href="#table_of_contents">^</a>

#### A.B.C. Adjectives without head nouns

An attributive adjective may occur with no overt head noun when the noun is contextually retrievable or considered unimportant. When this happens, the bare adjective stands as the head of the noun phrase and can take Set A markers like a noun.

    (A.#) ????????? ?????
          ?????????          ?????
          IMP:P3SG:give:A2SG red:A1SG
          'Give me a red one'

    (A.#) ??? ??? ???????

The personal pronouns of Ekhwachi are summarized below:

  </tr>
</table>

Figure A. _Personal pronouns._

The third person pronouns are morphologically and syntactically identical to demonstrative pronouns, which are described in detail in the following section.

Because the main arguments of verb phrases are indexed on the verb, these pronouns are rarely seen outside of prepositional phrases.

<!--

_\[All plural pronouns, except possibly for one of 1PL, are derived from their singular counterparts with a prefix that diachronically comes from the associative plural particle. 1PL.IN was derived before this by juxtaposing 1 and 2 and doesn't technically require the particle, but it might just be used by analogy\]_ (?)

_\[When verbs begin to agree with their objects, all third person forms cliticize and become affixes on the verbs. Because the medial demonstratives are so much more common than the others, those agreement markers eventually supercede the others\]_ (?)

There are no number distinctions, and noun coordination is done by simple juxtaposition, so communicating the first person plural is done with "me you" or "me \[demonstrative\]" while the second person plural is done with "you \[demonstrative\]".

-->

### <a name="demonstrative_pronouns"></a>A.B. Demonstrative pronouns <a href="#table_of_contents">^</a>

The demonstrative pronouns are the same as the third person pronouns from the previous section, and they can also be used as determiners. They are repeated below for convenience.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th></th>
    <th>Singular</th>
    <th>Plural</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Proximal</th>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Distal</th>
    <td>???</td>
    <td>???</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Figure A. _Demonstratives._

These demonstratives have a three-way distance contrast of proximal/medial/distal, which basically correspond to the English demonstratives 'this', 'that', and dated/dialectal 'yon'. Because 'yon' is not recognizable to most English speakers, (?)/(?) will be translated as 'that/those over there', but for brevity they will still be glossed as 'yon'.

    (A.#) ??? ??? ??? ?????
          ???    ???      ??? ?????
          DEF.PL mushroom red PL:this
          'these red mushrooms'

    (A.#) ????????? ???
          ?????????          ???
          IMP:P3SG:take:A2SG this
          'Take this'

    (A.#) ??? ??? ??? ???????
          ???    ???   ???  ???????
          DEF.SG tiger that P3SG:ITV:be.big
          'That tiger is very big'

    (A.#) ????? ?????
          ????? ?????
          P3PL:be.pretty PL:that
          'Those/they are pretty'

    (A.#) ??? ????? ??? ??? ??? ??? ?????¿
          ??? ???????       ???    ???  ???
          Q   P3SG:see:A2PL DEF.SG hill yon
          'Do you see that hill over there?'

    (A.#) ???
          ???
          PL:yon
          'those over there'

The contrast between proximal/medial/distal is based on physical distance away from the speaker and doesn't account for the listener's position. In practice, the medial demonstratives are used most commonly for referents near the listener because the listener is rarely close or far enough away that the other forms would be appropriate. The medial demonstratives are also commonly used to refer to things that have already been mentioned in discourse.

### <a name="reflexive_pronouns"></a>A.B. Reflexive pronouns <a href="#table_of_contents">^</a>

For reflexive constructions, the verb becomes intransitive and is immediately followed by the noun (?). This is an instance of Type I noun incorporation, so no words can come between the verb and (?).

    (A.#) ????? ???
          ∅-??-???      ???
          PFV-P1SG-wash REFL
          'I washed myself'

    (A.#) ??? ??? ????? ????? ??? ???
          ???    ???    ?????   ?????             ???  ???
          DEF.PL person this:PL PROG:P3PL:protect REFL just(?)
          'These people are just protecting themselves'

The reflexive is not used when originally, the A is acting on a P that it possesses, especially when P is part of its body.

    (A.#) ????? ???
          ?????         ???
          PFV:P1SG:bite tongue
          'I bit myself in the tongue', or 'I bit my tongue'

    (A.#) * ??????? ??? ??? ?????
            ???????            ???  ???    ?????
            PFV:P3SG:bite:A1SG REFL DEF.SG tongue:A1SG
            Intended: 'I bit myself in the tongue', or 'I bit my tongue'

    (A.#) ????? ???
          ?????        ???
          PFV:P3SG:cut palm(?)
          'He cut himself in the palm', or 'He cut his (own) palm'

    (A.#) * ??????? ??? ??? ?????
            ???????           ???  ???    ?????
            PFV:P3SG:cut:A1SG REFL DEF.SG palm(?):A1SG
            Intended: 'He cut himself in the palm', or 'He cut his (own) palm'

Additionally, (?) can be used as an intensifier, in which case it can be used adnominally or adverbally.

    (A.#) ????? ??? ??? ????????? ?????
          ?????       ???  ??? ?????????              ?????
          sister:A1SG REFL INC PROG:P3SG:grow(?):A3SG bamboo.forest(?):A3SG

    (A.#) ??? ??? ??????? ??? ???

          chief REFL PFV:P3SG:cook:A3SG for 1PL.IN
          'The chief himself cooked it for us'

    (A.#) ??? ??????? ??? ??? ???

          'The chief cooked it for us himself'

### <a name="indefinite_pronouns"></a>A.B. Indefinite pronouns <a href="#table_of_contents">^</a>

Indefinite pronouns in Ekhwachi are identical to or otherwise derived from the interrogative pronouns of the previous section. There are four different series of indefinite pronouns in Ekhwachi, which are listed alongside their English translations in the table below. I will be following the framework and terminology used in Haspelmath (1997), which describes indefinite pronouns as performing nine distinct but interrelated functions.

Figure A. _Indefinite pronouns._

#### A.B.C. The A-series

This corresponds only to Haspelmath's 'specific known' category. These pronouns refer to indefinites that are both specific and known to the speaker. This series is formed by taking an interrogative pronoun and following it with an appropriate classifier.

    (A.#) ??????? ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ???
          ???????            ???  ???      ???      ???    ???    ???  ???
          PFV:P3SG:PASS:find what CLF.NHAN fearsome LOC(?) DEF.SG cave that
          'Something fearsome was found in that cave'

    (A.#) ??????? ??? ??????? ??? ??? ??? ??? ?????
          ???????                ???  ???????       ??? ???     ???  ???    ?????
          PFV:P3SG:watch(?):A1SG COMP PROG:P3SG:run who CLF.HUM from DEF.SG house:A3SG
          'I watched someone running out of his house'

#### A.B.C. The B-series

The B-series corresponds to four of Haspelmath's categories: 'specific unknown', 'irrealis non-specific', 'polar question', and 'conditional protasis'. The pronouns of this series are identical in form to the interrogative pronouns. Like its name suggests, the 'specific unknown' category refers to indefinites that are specific but unknown to the speaker.

    (A.#) ??? ????? ??? ????? ???
          ???    ?????      ???  ?????         ???
          DEF.SG sound:A3SG COMP PFV:P3SG:fall what
          'sound of something falling'

    (A.#) ??? ????????? ???
          ??? ?????????                  ???
          EPI PROG:P3SG:look.for(?):A3SG who
          'She must be looking for someone'

The 'irrealis non-specific' category refers to indefinites that are both non-specific and unknown to the speaker.

    (A.#) ??? ??? ????????? ???
          ??? ??? ?????????             ???
          Q   DEO SBJV(?):P3SG:eat:A1SG what
          'I wonder if I should eat something'

    (A.#) ????? ????????? ???
          ?????        ?????????                 ???
          P1SG:want(?) SBJV(?):P3SG:meet(?):A1SG when
          'I want to see her again sometime'

The 'polar question' category refers to indefinites that are used in affirmative polar questions.

    (A.#) ??? ?????¿ ??? ??????? ???¿
          ??? ?????        ??? ???????               ???
          Q   P2SG:be.good Q   PFV:P2SG:hurt:A3SG(?) who
          'Your face! Are you okay? Did someone hurt you?'

    (A.#) ??? ??????? ??? ??? ??? ???¿
          ??? ???????                ???    ???         ??? ???
          Q   PFV:P3SG:enter:A3SG(?) DEF.SG building(?) who suspicious
          'Did anyone suspicious enter the building?'

The 'conditional protasis' category refers to indefinites that are used within the dependent clause of a conditional statement.

    (A.#) ??? ??????? ??? ???, ?????????
          ??? ???????              ???  ???       ?????????
          if  ???(?):P3SG:COP.NHAN what dangerous IMP(?):P1PL.EX:call:A2PL
          'If there's anything dangerous, call out for us'

    (A.#) ??? ??? ??????? ??? ??? ??? ???, ??? ???????
          ???  ??? ???????                  ???  ???    ???     ??? ??? ???????
          even if  PFV:P3SG:cut.off(?):A3SG head DEF.SG monster who EPI SBJV(?):P3SG:survive
          'Even if someone cut off the monster's head, it should survive'

#### A.B.C. The C-series

The C-series corresponds to Haspelmath's 'indirect negation' and 'direction negation' categories, and its pronouns are formed by preceding interrogative pronouns with the focus particle (?). In both instances, the indefinite pronoun is within the scope of negation.

    (A.#) ??? ??? ??? ??????? ??? ???
          ??? ???  ??? ???????              ???    ???
          FOC what NEG PFV:P3SG:buy:A1PL.EX LOC(?) there
          'We didn't buy anything there'

    (A.#) ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ???????
          ???    ??? ??? ???  ??? ???????
          DEF.SG boy FOC what NEG P3SG:say:A3SG
          'The boy didn't say anything'

Like other focused arguments, a C-series pronoun always precedes the verb, and if it is originally an A, the verb is in the antipassive voice to promote it to the role of S.

    (A.#) ??? ??? ????????? ??? ??? ??? ????????? ??? ??? ??? ???¿
          ??? ??? ?????????              ???  ??? ??? ?????????             ???  ???    ???      ???
          Q   NEG ???(?):P3SG:think:A2SG COMP FOC who ABIL:P3SG(?):climb:AP with DEF.SG mountain yon
          'You don't think that anyone can climb that mountain?'

    (A.#) ??? ????? ??? ??? ??? ??? ????????? ??? ????
          ???    ?????         ???    ??? ??? ??? ?????????         ??? ????
          LOC(?) where:A3SG(?) forest FOC who NEG PROG:P3SG:know:AP Q   P3PL:COP.HUM
          'No one knows where they are in the forest'

#### A.B.C. The D-series

The D-series corresponds to Haspelmath's 'standard of comparison' and 'free choice' categories, and its pronouns are formed by fully reduplicating interrogative pronouns. Unlike the other series (?), these pronouns are grammatically plural.

    (A.#) ??? ????? ??? ????? ??? ??????
          ???    ?????        ???  ?????       ???  ???~???
          DEF.SG town:A1PL.EX this P3SG:be.old from any~where
          'This town of ours is older than anywhere (else)'

    (A.#) ????????? ??? ????? ?????
          ?????????            ???    ?????           ???~???
          ABIL:P3SG:learn:A3PL DEF.SG method(?):weave any~who
          'Anyone can learn how to weave'

    (A.#) ??? ????? ??? ??????? ??? ????? ??? ?????????
          ???    ?????         ???   ???????       ???  ???~??? ??? ?????????
          DEF.SG daughter:A1SG young P3SG:talk:HAB with any~who REL SBJV:P3PL:listen:AP
          'My young daughter talks to whoever will listen (to her)'

<!--
\['someone', 'something', etc. are based on interrogative words. These are likely formed by reduplication, though the kind of reduplication is not yet known, and the end result might be rendered as two separate words if it's full reduplication\]

1: specific, known to the speaker
   '[Somebody] called when you were away; guess who!'
   '[WHO-CLF] called when you were away; guess who!'
   ? 'PFV:P(?)3SG:call someone when ???:P2SG:go; IMP:P2SG:guess who CLF.HUM'
2: specific, unknown to the speaker
   'I heard [something], but I don't know what it was'
   'I heard [WHAT], but I don't know what it was'
   ? 'PFV:P3SG:hear:A1SG what, but NEG PROG:P1SG:know Q what'
3: irrealis non-specific
   'Please try [somewhere] else', 'She may go [somewhere]', 'Take care that [someone] doesn't lead you astray'
   'Please try [WHERE] else', 'She may go [WHERE]', 'Take care that [WHO] doesn't lead you astray'

   'If you see [anything], tell me immediately'
   'If you see [WHAT], tell me immediately'
   'if ???:P3SG:see:A2SG what, IMP:P1SG:tell:A2SG immediately'

The particle (?) is used to pluralize animate nouns that are not modified by any determiners. Its use is mandatory when plural reference is intended for such nouns.

### <a name="associative_plural"></a>A.B. The associative plural article (?) <a href="#table_of_contents">^</a>

The particle (?) is used to refer to form associative plurals, which refer to a heterogenous set consisting of an individual and their associates. Basically anyone can be associated with this referential individual, including family, friends, and people who are of only casual or transient acquaintance. This is most commonly used with proper names and kinship terms, and like the indefinite plural particle, it is restricted to animate nouns.

    (A.#) ????? ??? ??? ?????
          ?????           ??? ???    ?????

The counting system of Ekhwachi is decimal.

#### A.B.C. Cardinal numbers

Below are the patterns for the cardinal numbers from 1 to 20.

|    |     |    |     |
| -- | --- | -- | --- |
| 1  | ??? | 11 | ??? |
| 2  | ??? | 12 | ??? |
| 3  | ??? | 13 | ??? |
| 4  | ??? | 14 | ??? |
| 5  | ??? | 15 | ??? |
| 6  | ??? | 16 | ??? |
| 7  | ??? | 17 | ??? |
| 8  | ??? | 18 | ??? |
| 9  | ??? | 19 | ??? |
| 10 | ??? | 20 | ??? |

#### A.B.C. Ordinal numbers

\[ordinal numbers follow some regular pattern except for 'first', which is suppletive; likely derives from something meaning 'before'; other ordinals are formed with a preceding word or prefix\]

#### A.B.C. Fractions

Fractional numerals are formed with the affix _???_ (?), which is attached to the last numeral in the numeral phrase.

    (A.#) ????? ??? ???
          ?????(?)   ??? ???
          three.FRAC two CLF.INAN
          'two thirds', '2/3'

    (A.#) ??? ??? ????? ??? ???
          ??? ??? ?????    ???   ???
          ten and six.FRAC seven CLF.INAN
          'seven sixteenths', '7/16'

    (A.#) ??? ??? ??? ????? ??? ??? ??? ??? ???
          ???   ??? ??? ?????(?) ???   ??? ??? ???   ???
          eight ten and six.FRAC three ten and three CLF.INAN
          'thirty three eighty-sixths', '33/86'

When the fractional numeral is being used in conjunction with a noun, it is possessed by the noun and acts as the head of the noun phrase.

    (A.#) ????? ??????? ??? ??? ??? ???
          ??-  ???    ?????(?) -??   ???   ???      ???    ???
          P3PL-be.red four.FRAC-A3PL three CLF.INAN DEF.PL flower
          'Three fourths of the flowers are red'

    (A.#) ????? ??????? ??? ??? ??? ???
          ??-  ???    ?????(?) -??   ???   ???      ???    ???
          P3PL-be.red four.FRAC-A3SG three CLF.INAN DEF.SG flower
          'Three fourths of the flower are red'

#### A.B.C. Distributive numerals

Distributive numerals are formed using the prefix _??-_ (?).

### <a name="classifiers"></a>A.B. Classifiers <a href="#table_of_contents">^</a>

For nearly all nouns in Ekhwachi, they cannot be directly quantified with numerals; they must be accompanied by a classifier when they co-occur. While the prototypical use of these classifiers is to quantify nouns in this way, they occur without numerals in some constructions.

#### A.B.C. List of classifiers

Ekhwachi has (?) (currently 7) classifiers, which are summarized below.

| Classifier | Gloss     | Principal uses |
| ---------- | :-------- | :------------- |
| ???        | CLF.HUM   | Humans |
| ???        | CLF.NHUM  | Living nonhuman animates |
| ???        | CLF.plant | Plants and fungi |
| ???        | CLF.place | Physical locations, including natural locations such as forests as well as artificial ones such as houses or towns |
| ???        | CLF.long  | Essentially one-dimensional objects, which may be rigid, such as sticks or bones, or flexible, such as hair or rope |
| ???        | CLF.flat  | Essentially two-dimensional objects such as plates and most articles of clothing |
| ???        | CLF.INAN  | General-purpose classifier for inanimates not covered by other classifiers, including essentially three-dimensional objects, dead nonhuman(?) animates, and abstracts |

Figure A. _Classifiers._

#### A.B.C. Classifier usage

All classifiers can be directly quantified by numerals, and a numeral-classifier phrase can itself quantify a noun that precedes it.

    (A.#) ??? ???
          ??? ???
          two CLF.HUM
          'two people'

    (A.#) ??? ??? ???
          ???   ???   ???
          house three CLF.INAN
          'three houses'

When a noun is quantified by a numeral-classifier phrase, it may not be preceded by the indefinite plural particle (?), even when the numeral is greater than 1.

    (A.#) ??? ???
          ??? ???
          PL  child
          'children'

    (A.#) * ??? ??? ??? ???
          ??? ???   ???   ???
          PL  child three CLF.HUM
          Intended: 'three children'

When the numeral is greater than 1, the noun is still semantically and grammatically plural, as can be seen in agreement patterns of both verbs and demonstratives.

    (A.#) ????????? ??? ??? ??? ??? ?????
          ??? -???- ?????          ???    ???        ??? ???      ???-???
          PROG-P3PL-follow:A1PL.EX DEF.PL (bird sp.) two CLF.NHAN PL- that
          'We're following those two birds(?)'

All nouns can take at least one classifier, though some take multiple. All nonhuman animates usually take the classifier (?), but they take (?) if they are not alive at the point of reference.

    (A.#) ??????? ??? ??? ??? ??? ???
          ???????           ???  ???   ???      ???    ???
          PFV:P3PL:eat:A3SG fish three CLF.INAN DEF.SG bird
          'The bird ate three fish (which were already dead)'

    (A.#) ??????? ??? ??? ??? ???
          ???????           ???  ???   ???      ???    ???
          PFV:P3PL:eat:A3SG fish three CLF.NHAN DEF.SG bird
          'The bird ate three fish (alive)'

Additionally, nonhuman animates that are essentially one- or two-dimensional can take the shape-based classifiers (?) and (?), respectively, with little change in meaning, aside from the fact that animals quantified with them may be alive or dead.

    (A.#) ????? ??? ??? ???/??? ??? ??? ??? ?????!
          ?????         ???       ??? ???/???           ??? ???   ???    ?????
          P3SG:COP.NHAN manta.ray one CLF.NHAN/CLF.flat LOC under DEF.SG boat:A2PL
          'There's a manta ray under your boat!'

Anything that is especially close to being one- or two-dimensional can always take the relevant classifier, but things that are less prototypical can only take the classifier when they are closer to being the shape than is expected. For example, (?) can always be used to quantify snakes, but it would be generally unacceptable to use for dogs. However, (?) might be used to refer to a dachshund to draw attention to how much longer it is than most other dogs. It also might be used to refer to a particularly lanky person to draw attention to their proportions. This more or less metaphorical usage is quite marked and is restricted to less formal registers.

#### A.B.C. Classifiers without numerals

Classifiers have one main use outside of pairing with numerals to quantify nouns. An interrogative word followed by a classifier is used to form an indefinite pronoun, which refers to something specific and known to the speaker.

    (A.#) ??????? ??? ??? ?????? ??? ??? ??? ???
          ???????            ???  ???      ??????             ???    ???    ???   ???
          PFV:P3SG:find:A1SG what CLF.INAN ITV:interesting(?) LOC(?) DEF.SG river yesterday
          'I found something very interesting in the river yesterday'

#### A.B.C. Quantifying time

The only nouns that do not need classifiers to be quantified with numerals are those for units of time, such as 'hour', 'day', 'year', etc. While these words are like classifiers in that they can be directly quantified by numerals, which precede them, they cannot be used to quantify nouns.

    (A.#) ??? ???
          ???  ???
          four day
          'four days'
    
    (A.#) * ????? ??? ???
          ?????         ???  ???
          [(?)NMZ:]hunt five hour
          Intended: 'five hour's worth of hunting'
          Actual: 'hunting for five hours'

          'these three too-heavy branches of a tree that fell'

#### A.B.C. Relationships between elements

The indefinite and associative plural particles (?) and (?) cannot occur in the presence of a classifier. Additionally, a genitive may only be expressed if the head noun has a possessive suffix. This genitive is itself a full noun phrase. When both a genitive and a relative clause are present, it is ambiguous as to whether it is modifying the genitive or the head of the noun phrase.

    (A.#) ??? ????? ??? ??? ??? ?????
          ???    ?????     ???    ???   ??? ?????
          DEF.SG face:A3SG DEF.SG woman REL P3SG:be.beautiful

(?)

### <a name="nominal_locative_predication"></a>A.B. Nominal and locative predication <a href="#table_of_contents">^</a>

Nominal predicates in Ekhwachi don't make use of any overt verb-like element, but locative predication is done with one of a small set of locative copular verbs, which differ based on the animacy of the subject. The constructions used for locative predication are also used for predicative possession.

#### A.B.C. Nominal predication

To express that two things are the same, they are usually simply juxtaposed without an overt copula. Unlike verbal predicates, their topics always precede them, and they don't take agreement morphology, so they require that a noun phrase precede them.

    (A.#) ??? ?????
          ?????       ???
          father:A1SG shaman
          'My father was/is/will be a shaman'

    (A.#) ??? ??? ??? ??? ???
          ???    ???   ??? ???    ???
          DEF.PL tiger PL  animal dangerous
          'Tigers were/are/will be dangerous animals'

    (A.#) ??? ?????
          ???  ?????
          that responsibility:A1PL.EX
          'It/that is our responsibility'

In line with other predicates, they will generally be translated as being in the present tense throughout this document except in the examples immediately above. Even without an overt copula, the nominal predicate takes non-inflectional verb morphology, including the negative particle (?), and the mood particles (?) and (?). They can also be relativized in the same way.

    (A.#) ??? ??? ??? ???
          ??? ??? ??? ???
          2SG NEG DEO thief
          'You shouldn't be a thief'

    (A.#) ??? ??? ???
          ???  ??? ???
          that NEG joke
          'You're kidding me', 'You can't be serious', etc. (lit. 'That's not a joke')

    (A.#) ????? ??? ?????
          ?????       ??? ?????
          mother:A3SG REL friend:A1SG
          'her mother, who is my friend'

#### Locative predication

The locative copulas (?), (?), and (?) are used to express locative as well as existential predication. The first is used for humans, the second for non-human animates, and the third for inanimates.

    (A.#) ???, ????? ??? ??? ???
          ???  ?????        ???    ??? ???
          here P3PL:COP.HUM person two CLF.HUM
          'Here, there are two people'

    (A.#) ??? ????? ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ????? ???
          ??? ?????         ???    ???     ???  ???    ???    ?????     ???
          EPI P3SG:COP.NHAN DEF.SG bear(?) that LOC(?) DEF.SG cave:A3SG now
          'That bear should be in its cave now'

    (A.#) ????? ??? ??? ??? ???
          ?????         ???    ???    ???    ???
          P3SG:COP.INAN basket LOC(?) DEF.SG floor
          'There is a basket on the floor'

These copulae are also used for predicative possession. The syntactic subject is the possessed noun with a Set A marker, and the semantic possessor is the object of the locative preposition (?). Pronominal possessors are expressed only by their corresponding Set A markers.

    (A.#) ????? ????? ??? ???
          ?????        ?????      ???  ???
          P3PL:COP.HUM child:A1SG five CLF.HUM
          'I have five children'

    (A.#) ??? ??? ??? ????? ????? ??? ???
          ???    ???  ???  ?????         ?????    ???   ???
          DEF.SG fish this P3PL:COP.INAN eye:A3SG three CLF.INAN
          'This fish, it has three eyes'

    (A.#) ????? ??? ??? ???
          ?????         ??? ???   ???
          P3PL:COP.INAN eye three CLF.INAN
          'There are three eyes'


## <a name="coordination"></a>A. Coordination <a href="#table_of_contents">^</a>

### <a name="coordination_content"></a>A.B. Content of this section (?) <a href="#table_of_contents">^</a>

The conjunction (?) 'and' coordinates two or more noun phrases, verb phrases, or clauses.

### <a name="coreferential_deletion"></a>A.B. Coreferential deletion (?) <a href="#table_of_contents">^</a>

When the verbs in two clauses share at least one argument, that argument can usually be deleted. A verb expects certain kinds of arguments, either explicitly due to agreement or implicitly through its semantics, and if only one of the available arguments can meet those expectations, it can be deleted in the second clause.

Otherwise, when verb agreement and semantics don't make clear how to interpret the second clause when an argument is deleted, there are two patterns of deletion. In the first pattern, which is used when no argument is topicalized, coordination is syntactically ergative; it can be deleted if it is a P in the second clause. In the second pattern, which is used when an argument is topicalized, coordination is syntactically accusative; it can be deleted if it is an S or A in the second clause.

In practice, this is a strong tendency rather than an absolute rule. More accurately, the patterns describe the default interpretation without further context, but the interpretation can change if more information is made available.

#### <a name="coreferential_deletion_unique"></a>A.B.C. Deleting a grammatically or semantically unique argument <a href="#table_of_contents">^</a>

As in many head-marking languages, an argument can be deleted regardless of its syntactic role when agreement patterns keep the information unambiguous.

    ??????? ??? ??? ?????
    ???????           ??? ??? ?????
    PFV:P3PL:see:A1SG and INC PFV:P1SG:run
    'I saw them and I started to run'

The same applies for verb semantics and context. In the example below, the two available arguments are the boulder and the tiger, and while syntactically it would be expected that the boulder would be coordinated, instead it is the tiger that is. Because the tiger is animate and the boulder is not, and because the tiger presumably suffered a possibly mortal injury from the boulder having fallen on it, it is the only argument that can satisfy (?), 'to die'.

    ????? ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ?????
    ?????         ???    ???     ??? ???   ??? ?????
    PFV:P3SG:fall DEF.SG boulder LOC tiger and PFV:P3SG:die
    'The boulder fell on a tiger and it (the tiger) died'

#### <a name="coreferential_deletion_unique"></a>A.B.C. Deleting a non-unique argument <a href="#table_of_contents">^</a>

There are times when no combination of agreement marking, context, or verbal semantics serves to unambiguously indicate what argument may carry over between two clauses. When this ambiguity occurs, it is usually topicalization that determines which can be deleted in the second clause. In sentences without a topicalized argument, when two coordinated clauses share a common NP, it can only be deleted in the second clause when it is a P in both clauses. In other words, clausal coordination in these constructions is syntactically ergative.

          'The hunter stood up and the bear killed him'

However, when an S or A is topicalized, it is only deleted in the second clause when it is an S or A there as well.

In the case where the shared NP is an O in the first clause and an A in the second, it may be deleted if the verb in the second clause is rendered in the antipassive voice, but it is equally possible to just restate the argument.

### <a name="compounding_incorporation_incorporation"></a>A.B. Noun incorporation <a href="#table_of_contents">^</a>

In this section, I will be following the terminology put forth in Mithun (1984), perhaps the most widely cited work on noun incorporation (NI). In that framework, Ekhwachi would be described as a language that uses both Type I and Type II NI.

I will first describe NI in general and its use in Ekhwachi before describing both types individually. Then, I will explain why I analyze these constructions as NI, since their realization in Ekhwachi is not so prototypical. For the rest of this section, every example that makes use of NI will appear with a corresponding example that does not use NI for clarity.

#### A.B.C. A brief overview of noun incorporation

In NI, a bare noun is compounded with a verb to derive a new lexical item, which is also a verb. Some examples from English would be _babysit_ and _berry-pick_. In Mithin's framework, she categorizes four types of noun incorporation, such that a language with one type of NI should have all types below it. In Ekhwachi, both Type I and Type II are highly productive.

In Type I NI, the noun and verb combine to form a verb of lower valency, which is usually intransitive.

> Such compounding has a significant effect on the role of the N involved. In _He is berry-picking_, the word berry does not refer to a specific _berry_, nor to a particular bushful of berries: it qualifies the V, describing the type of picking in progress.
> (Mithun 1984, p. 849)

Type II NI is essentially similar to Type I, except that the verb retains its original valency. Instead of reducing its valency, another argument fills the void left by the incorporated noun. For example, the possessor of an incorporated P becomes the new P in the clause.

#### A.B.C. Realization of noun incorporation in Ekhwachi

Noun incorporation in Ekhwachi is realized differently than it is in often-cited polysynthetic languages that have it. The incorporated noun stays as an independent word which retains its own stress and is not phonologically attached to the verb in any way.

    ????? ???
    ?????           ???
    PFV:1SG:go.numb leg
    'My leg fell asleep'

    ????? ??? ?????
    ?????           ???    ???
    PFV:3SG:go.numb DEF.SG leg:A1SG
    'My leg fell asleep'

There are restrictions on what nouns may be incorporated. The vast majority of the time, a noun can only be incorporated if it is inanimate as well as originally a P; hypothetical words with meanings like _knife-cut_ or _mainland-go_ are usually ungrammatical, and the few words in the language that incorporate non-P arguments are calqued from other languages. Animate nouns are only incorporated with (?), 'to eat', as well as a small subset of verbs which strongly expect an animate P, such as (?), 'to hunt'.

#### A.B.C. Type I incorporation

In Type I noun incorporation, a P is incorporated into a transitive or intransitive verb, and the resulting verb is intransitive.

    ??? ??? ??????? ???
    ???    ???       ???????       ???
    DEF.SG (bat sp.) PROG:P3SG:eat peach
    'The bat is eating peaches'

    ??? ??? ????????? ??? ???
    ???    ???       ?????????          ??? ???
    DEF.SG (bat sp.) PROG:P3PL:eat:A3SG PL  peach
    'The bat is eating peaches'

The main purpose of Type I NI is to lexicalize an institutionalized or otherwise recognized activity.

    ????? ??? ???
    ?????           ???  ???
    PFV:P1PL.EX:eat rice yesterday
    'We ate rice yesterday'

    ??????? ??? ??? ???
    ???????              ???    ???  ???
    PFV:P3PL:eat:A1PL.EX DEF.PL rice yesterday
    'We ate rice yesterday'

Since the incorporated noun is no longer indexed on the verb, the number of the incorporated noun becomes ambiguous if it wasn't already.

    ??? ????? ????? ??? ???!
    ???    ?????        ?????          ??? ???
    DEF.SG husband:A1SG PFV:P3SG:break arm yesterday
    'My husband broke his arm(s) yesterday!'

    ??? ????? ??????? ??? ????? ???!
    ???    ?????        ???????             ???    ?????    ???
    DEF.SG husband:A1SG PFV:P3SG:break:A3SG DEF.SG arm:A3SG yesterday
    'My husband broke his arm yesterday!'

There are not many instances of NI involving originally intransitive verbs, but it occurs customarily with weather verbs.

    ??????? ???
    ???????        ???
    PROG:3SG:shine sun
    'The sun is shining' (lit. 'It's sun-shining')

    ??????? ??? ???
    ???????        ???    ???
    PROG:3SG:shine DEF.SG sun
    'The sun is shining'

    ??????? ???
    ???????              ???
    PROG:3SG:precipitate rain
    'It's raining'

    ??????? ??? ???
    ???????              ???    ???
    PROG:3SG:precipitate DEF.SG rain
    'It's raining', or '(The) rain is falling'

With these verbs and all other instances of Type I NI applied to intransitive verbs, no noun can be used as an S. Their verb agreement prefixes basically index a dummy subject.

#### A.B.C. Type II incorporation

Type II noun incorporation is much like Type I, but another argument is promoted to become a P. The most common use case is incorporating a possessed P in order to realize its possessor as a P. In particular, when something happens to a body part of a living thing, people tend to pay more attention to how the action affected the possessor rather than the body part itself. The promotion of the possessor to the role of P reflects this preference.

    ??? ??? ??????? ???
    ???    ???   ???????            ???
    DEF.SG tiger PFV:P3SG:bite:A3SG neck
    'The tiger bit its neck'

    ??? ??? ??????? ??? ?????
    ???    ???   ???????            ???    ?????
    DEF.SG tiger PFV:P3SG:bite:A3SG DEF.SG neck:A3SG
    'The tiger bit its neck'

While the case with body parts is the most prototypical, this application of NI is commonly found for any possessed P.

    ??????? ???
    ???????             ???
    PFV:P2SG:steal:A3PL spear
    'They stole your spear!'

    ??????? ??? ?????
    ???????             ???    ?????
    PFV:P3SG:steal:A3PL DEF.SG spear:A2SG
    'They stole your spear!'

Because a benefactive recipient is usually realized as the syntactic possessor of the P, Type II NI often results in what superficially resembles a secundative construction.

    ??????? ???
    ???????            ???
    PFV:P1SG:give:A3SG axe
    'She gave me an axe'

    ??????? ?????
    ???????            ?????
    PFV:P3SG:give:A3SG axe:A1SG
    'She gave me an axe'

The use of Type II NI for this kind of possessor-raising is highly productive to the point of being ubiquitous in natural discourse. In practice, NI is only not used this way when the P is unable to be incorporated because it is modified more than minimally, animate, or focused, even though a construction without NI is always grammatical.

    ??????? ??? ??? ???
    ???????            ???  ???    ???
    PFV:P1SG:hold:A3SG hand DEF.SG child
    'The child held my hand'

    ??????? ??? ????? ??? ???
    ???????            ???    ?????     ???    ???
    PFV:P3SG:hold:A3SG DEF.SG hand:A1SG DEF.SG child
    'The child held my hand' (odd because (?) is minimally modified)

    ??????? ??? ????? ??? ??? ???
    ???????            ???    ?????     ???  ???    ???
    PFV:P3SG:hold:A3SG DEF.SG hand:A1SG left DEF.SG child
    'The child held my left hand' (NI unavailable)

    * ??????? ??? ??? ??? ???
      ???????            ???  ???  ???    ???
      PFV:P1SG:hold:A3SG hand left DEF.SG child
      Intended: 'The child held my left hand'

Additionally, transitive verbs resulting from Type II NI can still undergo valency-reducing operations, including the antipassive and passive voices.

    ??????? ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ???
    ???????            ???  ???    ???   ???    ??? ???
    PFV:P3PL:make:A3SG boat DEF.PL chief DEF.SG man young
    'The young man made (a boat/boats) for the chiefs'

    ??????? ????? ??? ??? ??? ??? ???
    ???????            ?????     ???    ???   ???    ???  ???
    PFV:P3SG:make:A3SG boat:A3PL DEF.PL chief DEF.SG man young
    'The young man made a boat for the chiefs'

    ??????? ??? ??? ??? ???
    ???????          ???  ???    ??? ???
    PFV:P3SG:make:AP boat DEF.SG man young
    'The young man made (a boat/boats) (for someone/others)'

    ??????? ??? ??? ???
    ???????            ???  ???    ???
    PFV:P3PL:PASS:make boat DEF.PL chief
    'The chiefs were made (a boat/boats)' (lit. 'The chiefs were boat-made')

When applied in NI constructions, these voices have the same restrictions as they normally do. For example, relativizing an A requires use of the antipassive voice.

    ??? ??? ????? ??? ????????? ??? ??? ??? ?????
    ???    ???    ?????   ??? ?????????         ???  ???  ???    ?????
    DEF.PL person PL:this REL PROG:P3PL:bury:AP rice with DEF.PL family:A3PL
    'these people who are planting rice for their families'

    ??? ??? ????? ??? ????????? ??? ????? ??? ?????
    ???    ???    ?????   ??? ?????????         ???  ?????     ???    ?????
    DEF.PL person PL:this REL PROG:P3PL:bury:AP with rice:A3PL DEF.PL family:A3PL
    'these people who are planting rice for their families'

#### A.B.C. Reasons for the analysis as noun incorporation

(?)


## <a name="relative_clauses"></a>A. Relative clauses <a href="#table_of_contents">^</a>

### <a name="relative_clauses_introduction"></a>A.B. Introduction <a href="#table_of_contents">^</a>

For the rest of this section, relative clauses and their head nouns will be surrounded by square brackets when they appear in glosses containing other words.

Relative clauses in Ekhwachi are placed after the nouns they modify, and they are separated by the relativizer (?). When the head noun is the patient of the verb in the relative clause, it is only expressed with verb agreement.

    (A.#) ??? ??? ???????
          ???  ??? ???????
          tree REL PROG:P3SG:fall
          'a tree that is falling'

    (A.#) ??? ??? ??? ???????
          ???    ???  ??? ???????
          DEF.SG girl REL PFV:PS3G:praise:A1PL.EX
          'the girl that we praised'

    (A.#) ??? ??? ??? ?????????
          ???    ??? ??? ?????????
          DEF.SG man REL PROG:PS3G:carrying:A2PL
          'the man that you're carrying'

Agents cannot be directly relativized. In order to relativize an agent, it must first be promoted to the role of subject by rendering the verb in the antipassive voice. The object, which is no longer indexed on the verb, can optionally be expressed as an oblique argument.

    (A.#) ??? ??? ??? ??????? (??? ???)
          ???    ???  ??? ???????            (???  ???)
          DEF.SG girl REL PFV:P3SG:praise:AP (with 1PL.EX)
          'the girl who praised (us)'

    (A.#) ??? ??? ??? ????????? (??? ???)
          ???    ??? ??? ?????????          (???  ???)
          DEF.SG man REL PROG:P3SG:carry:AP (with 2PL)
          'the man who is carrying (you)'

When the head noun is of any other role, such as the destination of a verb of motion, an indirect object, or an instrument, the head noun is explicitly expressed in the relative clause by a resumptive pronoun that is inserted in situ, or in the case of a relativized genitive, realized as a Set A marker.

    (A.#) ??? ??? ????? ??? ???
          ???   ??? ?????       ??? ???
          field REL PFV:P1SG:go LOC yon
          'a field that I went to'

    (A.#) ??? ??? ????????? ????? ??? ???
          ???   ??? ?????????        ?????       ???  ???
          spear REL P3SG:hunt:HAB:AP sister:A2SG with that
          'a spear that your sister hunts with'

    (A.#) ??? ??? ??? ??????? ?????
          ???    ???    ??? ???????                 ???   -??
          DEF.SG boy(?) REL PFV:P1PL.IN:invite:AS3G father-A3SG
          'the boy whose father invited us'

### <a name="relative_clauses_shifting"></a>A.B. Relative clauses and shifting <a href="#table_of_contents">^</a>

NPs containing relative clauses often influence the order in which constituents appear, owing to the fact that they tend to be comparatively long and/or complex. For brevity, we will call such NPs "heavy". It is generally dispreferred that any arguments or adjuncts occur after especially heavy NPs, so they tend to appear earlier in the phrase than is typical when they co-occur.

The examples below demonstrate this principle. The basic, unmarked order of constituents in a clause containing a transitive verb and an adjunct is verb-object-agent-adjunct.

    (A.#) ??????? ??? ????? ??? ??? ??? ???
          ???????            ???    ?????     ???    ??? ???    ???
          PFV:P3SG:push:A3PL DEF.SG boat:A3PL DEF.PL man LOC(?) river
          'The men pushed their boat into a river'

The agent may be fronted and precede the verb without any additional marking due to being topicalized, and the adjunct may occur in any position between phrases, but the example above gives the most pragmatically neutral word order. When the NP involving the boat is made heavier by modifying it with an adjective and a relative clause, it causes the verb to be in the antipassive voice to facilitate fronting of the agent, though the adjunct is only somewhat more likely to precede the heavy NP than before.

    (A.#) ??????? ??? ??? ??? ??? ????? ??? ??? ??????? ??? ???
          ???????          ???    ??? ???  [???    ?????     ??? ??? ???????]           ???    ???
          PFV:P3PL:push:AP DEF.PL man with [DEF.SG boat:A3PL new REL PFV:P3SG:buy:A3PL] LOC(?) river
          'The men pushed their new boat that they bought into a river'

When the relative clause above is especially heavy, containing adjuncts or its own relative clauses, the adjunct is also fronted and appears before it.

    (A.#) ??????? ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ????? ??? ??? ??????? ??? ??? ??? ??? ?????????
          ???????          ???    ??? ???    ???   ???  [???    ?????     ??? ??? ???????           ???    [???    ???  ??? ?????????]]
          PFV:P3PL:push:AP DEF.PL man LOC(?) river with [DEF.PL boat:A3PL new REL PFV:P3SG:buy:A3PL LOC(?) [DEF.SG town REL P3SG:visit:HAB:A3PL]]
          'The men pushed into a river their new boat that they bought in the town that they often visit'

While the above examples happen to show this with a transitive verb, the same reordering can also be observed whenever any verb is followed by two or more overt arguments or adjuncts.

The kinship terminology of Ekhwachi reflects a cultural practice of grouping families by matrilineal descent groups, following basically an Iroquois system. The abbreviations used for relationship terms in this section are the standard ones used when discussing kinship terminology, but they are listed below for convenience.

| Term   | Symbol | Term     | Symbol |
| ------ | ------ | -------- | ------ |
| mother | M      | sister   | Z      |
| father | F      | brother  | B      |
| parent | P      | daughter | D      |
| child  | C      | son      | S      |

Figure A. _Abbreviations used for kinship terms in this section._

The charts on the next two pages compare the kin terms used in Ekhwachi to their corresponding terms in English. The terms are grouped by the following list of priorities, with priorities higher on the list outranking those below them.

1. Members of the same generation are grouped together
2. Terms for members of ego's clan come before non-members
3. Terms for female relatives come before terms for male relatives
4. Terms for closer relatives come before more distant relatives

Figure A. <i>A comparison of kinship terms in Ekhwachi and English that don't differ based on ego's gender. The left half of this table groups by Ekhwachi terms as much as possible, and the right half does so with English terms. For 'M<sup>n</sup>ZD<sup>n</sup>' and 'F<sup>n</sup>BS<sup>n</sup>', the superscript indicates that the first and third relations are repeated</i> n <i>times, such as in MZD, FFBSS, MMMZDDD, etc.</i>
