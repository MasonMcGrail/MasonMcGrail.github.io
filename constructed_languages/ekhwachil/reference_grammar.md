# A Grammar of Ekhwachil

This is a redirect for my constructed language Ekhwachi, which used to be called Ekhwachil. When I changed the name of the language, the link that I pointing to the reference grammar broke, but the reference grammar for the language with its new name can be found [here](https://masonmcgrail.github.io/constructed_languages/01/reference_grammar.html).

This redirect will be taken down on ***August 21st, 2023***.
