## Copyrighting a constructed language

On this page, I outline my interpretation of what it means to copyright a constructed language (conlang), which I feel is necessary since I use a [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/) license for my work.

As a disclaimer, I am _not_ a lawyer, I am not _your_ lawyer, and I am _not giving any legal advice or opinion_. Also, when I say 'copyright', I am only talking about copyright law in the US since that is what is most familiar to me and most relevant to my work.

### My interpretation

There is plenty of legal precedent for copyrighting _expressions_ of or in a language, such as a reference grammar, dictionary, or collection of poetry. These cases are unambiguously protected under copyright law, and so I will not address them much further.

Copyrighting a constructed language, on the other hand, is more of a grey area, which, as of the time of writing, has no clear legal precedent. Unlike natural languages, these can be attributed to one or more specific authors, and with the exception of _a posteriori_ conlangs, they are not necessarily derived from something in the public domain. However, it is not possible to copyright ideas, facts, or concepts themselves, and a language is nothing if not a collection of interrelated ideas and concepts.

With the above in mind, I have listed below my interpretation of what parts of a conlang are protected under copyright law, given the legal precedent that I am aware of.

I believe that the following are **protected**:

* Expressions of the language made by a creator of the language, such as reference grammars, dictionaries, or works of poetry

I believe that the following are **not protected**:

* Grammatical features and rules
  * All parts of grammar, from something as broad as basic syntax to something as narrow as the use of a particular construction in a very culturally-specific context, are clearly ideas and thus not protected by copyright.
  * For example, a conlang may have a very fixed word order of subject-verb-object. I can very well see that and make my own language with that same word order, and it would not be copyright infringement. Also, in this case, there are hundreds of natural and constructed languages that have that word order, so it would be impossible to reasonably claim that idea as original.
  * Even if a feature or rule of grammar is completely original and unique to a specific conlang, it is still an idea and thus not protected.
* Individual words in the lexicon, in terms of both meaning and form
  * In the same vein as above, the meanings/definitions of words are not protected, since they are ideas. I cannot see a word and its definition in another conlang that I like and copy and paste it into my own, because the author's _expression_ is protected, but I can still take the idea and use it in my own work.
  * Likewise, if for example ⟨saka⟩ is a word in my conlang, someone else can also have the word ⟨saka⟩ in their language with the same or a different meaning, and it wouldn't be copyright infringement, even if I made my word first. 
  
I believe that the following are especially **ambiguous with regard to protection**:

* Use of the language
  * In general, I would argue that people other than the creator(s) of a conlang producing content in it is fair use. If the content is being used primarily for commercial purposes or defamation, that likely doesn't qualify as fair use.

### My intentions in using a Creative Commons license for my work

All of my conlangs use a <a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License</a>. I am using this license just to give other creators explicit permission to use them in certain circumstances if they would like to. I don't _expect_ that anyone else would want to transform my work or use it for commercial purposes, but I want people to be able to freely redistribute it. In the event that the above link breaks, I have copied and pasted a summary of the license's permissions and terms below:

> You are free to:
> * Copy and redistribute the material in any medium or format
> * Remix, transform, and build upon the material
>
> Under the following terms:
> * You must give appropriate credit, provide a link to the license, and indicate if changes were made. You may do so in any reasonable manner, but not in any way that suggests the licensor endorses you or your use.
> * You may not use the material for commercial purposes.
> * If you remix, transform, or build upon the material, you must distribute your contributions under the same license as the original.
> * You may not apply legal terms or technological measures that legally restrict others from doing anything the license permits.

How this applies to my works about my languages, such as my reference grammars, is mostly self-evident. My interpretation in applying the license to my languages themselves is: _Under the terms given above_, you may copy and redistribute my conlangs, and you may remix, transform, and build upon them to make new conlangs. For example, you may relex them or create new dialects or daughter languages for them if you were compelled to for some reason.
