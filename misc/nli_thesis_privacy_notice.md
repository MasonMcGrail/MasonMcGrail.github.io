This page serves as a privacy notice for the corpora [The Advanced Finnish Learners’ Corpus (LAS2)](http://urn.fi/urn:nbn:fi:lb-201407167) and [International Corpus of Learner Finnish (ICLFI)](http://urn.fi/urn:nbn:fi:lb-20140730163) in my master's thesis in the Cloud-Driven Artificial Intelligence program at Centria UAS. Both are available at [Kielipankki](https://www.kielipankki.fi/), also called the Language Bank in English.

## Persons responsible and contact information

The data controller for this project is Centria AMK, and the main point of contact for this project is myself. My name is officially Mason McGrail, but I am in the process of changing it to Niko Kälinen, and I prefer to be addressed by that name. Professor Aliasghar Khavasi at Centria UAS is a responsible researcher in this project, acting as my advisor.

You can contact me about this project by email, using either my personal email <nikokalinen@gmail.com> or my school email <mason.mcgrail@centria.fi>. The latter may no longer exist in the future after my name change is complete, in which case <niko.kalinen@centria.fi> would be my new email. As I will lose access to both after graduation in mid-2026, my personal email would be the most reliable way to reach me in general. Professor Khavasi's email is <aliasghar.khavasi@centria.fi>.

## Purpose of processing personal data

Both datasets contain personal data, which I intend to anonymize or otherwise filter out because it only serves as noise in this project.

After anonymizing or similarly processing the personal data, I intend to use NLP techniques on the datasets to train an ML model to identify whether a text is written by a native Finnish speaker or a non-native. This model is the main component of the master's thesis that I am pursuing in the 2025-2026 academic year.

At best I hope to improve the state of the art for the native language identification task for Finnish, and at minimum I would like the model to be a useful tool for language learners who want to compare themselves against a native-like standard. Because I am limited to using only the smaller of the two datasets for training/evaluation, the former goal is unlikely to be reached.

## Legal basis for processing personal data

The legal basis of processing the data in these datasets is granted by Articles [6(1)(e)](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-6-gdpr/) and [89(1)](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-89-gdpr/) of the GDPR:

### Art. 6 GDPR: Lawfulness of processing

> 1. Processing shall be lawful only if and to the extent that at least one of the following applies:
> 
> ...
> 
> (e) processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller.

### Art. 89 GDPR: Safeguards and derogations relating to processing for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes

> 1. Processing for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes, shall be subject to appropriate safeguards, in accordance with this Regulation, for the rights and freedoms of the data subject. Those safeguards shall ensure that technical and organisational measures are in place in particular in order to ensure respect for the principle of data minimisation. Those measures may include pseudonymisation provided that those purposes can be fulfilled in that manner. Where those purposes can be fulfilled by further processing which does not permit or no longer permits the identification of data subjects, those purposes shall be fulfilled in that manner.

## Description of the personal data processed

The resources in question that contain personal data are the corpora [The Advanced Finnish Learners’ Corpus (LAS2)](http://urn.fi/urn:nbn:fi:lb-201407167) and [International Corpus of Learner Finnish (ICLFI)](http://urn.fi/urn:nbn:fi:lb-20140730163), both obtained from [Kielipankki](https://www.kielipankki.fi/).

Access to the ICLFI is limited to the web interface of [Korp](https://www.kielipankki.fi/korp), a collection of Kielipankki's corpora. It cannot be downloaded, and as a result it cannot and will not be used when training or evaluating the model. The LAS2 data is downloadable and will be the vast majority, if not the entirety, of the data used for training and testing. As mentioned elsewhere, this will only be processed in the EU/EEA, after anonymization of personal data.

For both corpora, the metadata available on the Kielipankki website and on [clarino.uib.no](clarino.uib.no) mentions that both contain personal data, but they do not describe anywhere what kind of data it is. Given the nature of the corpora, personal data is likely incidental and relatively minor. The data may occasionally contain more sensitive information if a data subject chose to share it in their writing, but this is not noted as a risk in the corpora's metadata.

## Recipients / Disclosures of data

The data will not be processed by particular other individuals or organizations. If the data must be processed with cloud services for the purposes of training the model, only anonymized/pseudonymized data will be processed.

## Transferring data outside the EEA

In accordance with the GDPR, this data will only be processed within the EU/EEA, and it will not be transferred elsewhere.

## Retention period of personal data

The personal data in the corpora will only be stored for as long as my thesis is incomplete, and it will be deleted thereafter. The exact date at which my thesis will be complete is unclear, but at the very latest, I will continue to store it until 1.7.2025. I will delete it earlier if possible, and in accordance with the datasets' policies, I will not, for example, reproduce the data on Github, a cloud drive, or similar.

To ensure that the data is properly deleted, I will deallocate it from the hard drive, overwrite it with cipher.exe, and then factory-reset the computer.

## How data subjects can exercise their rights in relation to personal data

Information on data subjects' rights in different situations can be found on the [Data Protection Ombudsman's website](https://tietosuoja.fi/en/what-rights-do-data-subjects-have-in-different-situations).

If data subjects have questions about their own personal data relating to these resources, they should contact Kielipankki. General information on the processing of personal data in Kielipankki can be found in their [Data Protection Statement](https://www.kielipankki.fi/data-protection-statement/).
