# Privacy notice

This page serves as a privacy notice for the corpora [The Advanced Finnish Learners’ Corpus (LAS2)](http://urn.fi/urn:nbn:fi:lb-201407167) and [International Corpus of Learner Finnish (ICLFI)](http://urn.fi/urn:nbn:fi:lb-20140730163) in my master's thesis in the Cloud-Driven Artificial Intelligence program at Centria UAS. Both are available at [Kielipankki](https://www.kielipankki.fi/), also called the Language Bank in English.

## Persons responsible and contact information

The data controller and main point of contact for this project is myself. My name is officially Mason McGrail, but I am in the process of changing it to Niko Kälinen, and I prefer to be addressed by that name.
You can contact me about this project by email, using either my personal email <nikokalinen@gmail.com> or my school email <mason.mcgrail@centria.fi>. The latter may no longer exist in the future after my name change is complete, in which case <niko.kalinen@centria.fi> would be my new email. As I will lose access to both after graduation in mid-2026, my personal email would be the most reliable way to reach me.

## Purpose of processing personal data

Both datasets contain personal data, which I intend to anonymize or otherwise filter out because it only serves as noise in this project. In this and future sections, I will discuss the purpose of processing the data in this project in general.

After anonymizing or similarly processing the personal data, I intend to use NLP techniques on the datasets to train an ML model to identify whether a text is written by a native Finnish speaker or a non-native. This model is the main component of the master's thesis that I am pursuing in the 2025-2026 academic year.
At best I hope to improve the state of the art for the native language identification task for Finnish, and at minimum I would like the model to be a useful tool for language learners who want to compare themselves against a native-like standard.

## Legal basis for processing personal data

The legal basis of processing the in these datasets can be found in [Article 6](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-6-gdpr/) of the GDPR, point (f):

> 1. Processing shall be lawful only if and to the extent that at least one of the following applies:
> 
> ...
> 
> (f) processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data, in particular where the data subject is a child.
>
> Point (f) of the first subparagraph shall not apply to processing carried out by public authorities in the performance of their tasks.

The above was retrieved from [gdpr-info.eu/art-6-gdpr](gdpr-info.eu/art-6-gdpr) on October 21st 2025.

In accordance with the GDPR, among other things, this data will only be processed within the EU/EEA. In accordance with the licenses of both datasets, among other things, this project will not be used for commercial or otherwise profit-making applications.

## Description of the personal data processed

The resources in question that contain personal data are the corpora [The Advanced Finnish Learners’ Corpus (LAS2)](http://urn.fi/urn:nbn:fi:lb-201407167) and [International Corpus of Learner Finnish (ICLFI)](http://urn.fi/urn:nbn:fi:lb-20140730163), both obtained from [Kielipankki](https://www.kielipankki.fi/).

For both corpora, the metadata available on the Kielipankki website and on [clarino.uib.no](clarino.uib.no) mentions that both contain personal data, but they do not describe anywhere what kind of data it is. Given the nature of the corpora, personal data is likely limited to links between data subjects' personal names, mother tongues, the texts they authored, and similar information. The data may occasionally contain more sensitive information if a data subject chose to share it in their writing, but this is not noted as a risk in the corpora's metadata.

## Recipients / Disclosures of data

The data will not be processed by particular other individuals or organizations. If the data must be processed with cloud services for the purposes of training the model, only anonymized/pseudonymized data will be processed.

## Transferring data outside the EEA

In accordance with the GDPR, this data will only be processed within the EU/EEA.

## Retention period of personal data

The personal data in the corpora will only be stored for as long as the training/testing process of the model is ongoing, and it will be deleted thereafter. Based on my personal and academic obligations, I will most likely retain the data through March 2026. At the very latest, I will continue to store it until I graduate in June 2026.

## How data subjects can exercise their rights in relation to personal data

Information on data subjects' rights in different situations can be found on the [Data Protection Ombudsman's website](https://tietosuoja.fi/en/what-rights-do-data-subjects-have-in-different-situations).

If data subjects have questions about their own personal data relating to these resources, they should contact Kielipankki. General information on the processing of personal data in Kielipankki can be found in their [Data Protection Statement](https://www.kielipankki.fi/data-protection-statement/).
