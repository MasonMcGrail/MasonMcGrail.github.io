### My intentions in using a Creative Commons license for my work

<link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="../stylesheets/main.css">

All of my conlangs use a <a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License</a>. I am using this license just to give other creators explicit permission to use them in certain circumstances if they would like to. I don't _expect_ that anyone else would want to transform my work or use it for commercial purposes, but I want people to be able to freely redistribute it. In the event that the above link breaks, I have copied and pasted a summary of the license's permissions and terms below:

> You are free to:
> * Copy and redistribute the material in any medium or format
> * Remix, transform, and build upon the material
>
> Under the following terms:
> * You must give appropriate credit, provide a link to the license, and indicate if changes were made. You may do so in any reasonable manner, but not in any way that suggests the licensor endorses you or your use.
> * You may not use the material for commercial purposes.
> * If you remix, transform, or build upon the material, you must distribute your contributions under the same license as the original.
> * You may not apply legal terms or technological measures that legally restrict others from doing anything the license permits.

How this applies to my works about my languages, such as my reference grammars, is mostly self-evident. My interpretation in applying the license to my languages themselves is: _Under the terms given above_, you may copy and redistribute my conlangs, and you may remix, transform, and build upon them to make new conlangs. For example, you may relex them or create new dialects or daughter languages for them if you were compelled to for some reason.
