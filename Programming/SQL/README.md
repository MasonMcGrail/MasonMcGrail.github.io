# Ekhwachil dictionary project

The files in this subdirectory are for a multilingual dictionary project for Ekhwachil, a constructed language of mine. Ultimately, I would like to have a working dictionary on this website with the same kind of functionality as [jisho.org](https://jisho.org/) for Japanese, or possibly Sylvia Sotomayor's [online dictionary](http://www.terjemar.net/kelen/Dict/dict0.php) for her language, [Kēlen](http://www.terjemar.net/kelen/kelen.php). Not being able to use PHP and/or SQL directly on GitHub Pages, I will probably make it accessible on the web with JavaScript and JSON instead.

The dictionary will mostly be providing dictionary entries for Ekhwachil terms in English and Japanese, though in the far future I might add French (Québécois). While the language's lexicon is underdeveloped, I will be using nativized English words as placeholders so that I can work on the dictionary as a proof of concept.
