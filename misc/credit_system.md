## The Credit System

<link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="../stylesheets/main.css">

The page describes the Credit System, a kind of large-scale budgeting system that I made to more effectively manage my time and money as well as achieve my personal and professional goals. This is a formalism of the system that has been generalized to be usable by anyone, even though I anticipate that I am the only person who will use it.

### 1. Overview

For many people, it can be difficult to be motivated to do things that are important to better themselves or their careers, and it's easy for them to feel guilty when they spend their time and money on self-care or fun instead of putting it towards the far future. Many people treat themselves when they have a vague sense that they've probably earned it, given how much they've worked recently or how tired they are. This works for most of them, but it's not very exact, and many people still feel hesitancy or guilt even after they've convinced themselves to splurge.

This document details the Credit System, under which you earn credits when you fulfill responsibilities and spend time doing the things you feel that you ought to do. These credits can be exchanged for free time or "treat yourself" money. This system rewards you for doing what you are *supposed* to do by giving you a resource that you can spend on things that you would *rather* do or buy.

### 2. Restrictions
Exchanging credits for desirables loses its meaning if desirables are easily acquired by other means. If you are using this system, it's assumed that the following holds:

#### 2.1. Money
If you have income, by default, all of your money is reserved for paying expenses, and extra money may be put into savings, retirement, or other long-term investments. Basically anything that you pay for that isn't just for your pleasure or enjoyment, such as bills and gifts for others, can be considered an expense.

#### 2.2. Free time
By default, you must exchange credits for time that you spend doing anything that is basically self-indulgent. Time spent enjoying yourself *with others* doesn't cost credits; by engaging with others socially, you're forming or maintaining relationships and putting good out into the world, which shouldn't have an associated cost.

#### 2.3. Exceptions
Advancing yourself means little if it's at the expense of your mental health. Your mental health is inherently valuable and should be protected for its own sake, and additionally, having good mental health makes it easier to do what you are supposed to do. The following are examples of activities don't cost any credits:

* Taking sanctioned breaks, including for meals. These breaks might be determined by you or by an employer.

* Taking a stroll to get some fresh air and clear the mind.

* Taking  time to recover after a very stressful event.

### 3. Ways to earn credits

The following is a list of ways to earn credits. Each option, when completed, earns you either 1 silver or 1 gold, which are the two types of credits. The differences between the two types are detailed in the next section.

#### 3.1. Being on your grind

*Earns 1 gold*

You spend an hour doing paid activity. Paid time off, including taking breaks in the workday and taking parental leave, counts as time spent doing paid activity.

#### 3.2. Developing yourself

*Earns 1 silver*

You make the effort to do an hour's worth of activity that does not make you money but advances you personally or professionally, such as exercising, filling out paperwork, responding to emails, or learning or maintaining skills.

Note that this refers to an hour's *worth* of activity and not just an hour *spent*. Be honest with yourself about whether you did an hour's worth of work or if you were mostly distracted and didn't get much done.

#### 3.3. Sleeping regularly

*Earns 1 silver*

You go to sleep no more than 30 minutes later than you intended, and you start your day no more than 30 minutes after the time you intended.

#### 3.4. Note: Using smaller intervals

**Being on your grind** and **Developing yourself** treat 1 hour as the smallest unit. There are probably many times when you are productive for 30 minutes or 90. In practice, recording time spent in intervals of 15 minutes is a good trade-off between precision and ease of use.

### 4. Ways to spend credits

Below is a list of things that you can spend 1 credit to buy. Silver can be exchanged for free time, and gold can be exchanged for either money or free time.

#### 4.1. Money

You can spend 1 gold to take an amount of money from your reserve  and spend it on whatever you want to buy. This amount is  equal to 5% of what you earn in an hour, on average, in a typical workweek, after taxes.

#### 4.2. Free time 

You can spend 1 silver to spend 30 minutes doing any kind of recreational activity. This might include things such as watching shows or movies, playing games, or creating art for fun. 1 gold is worth 45 minutes rather than 30.

### 4.3. Discounts

The exchange rates for credits given above are the defaults, but there are situations where the exchange rate is better.

On days that you consider "free days", 1 credit buys you 15 minutes more free time than usual. You might consider the weekend or holidays free days. In times when earning credits may as well be impossible, such as when commuting, you can spend time as you wish for free.

For special days where it would be expected that you treat yourself, 1 gold gets you 10% of your adjusted hourly income instead of 5%. An example of such a day might be your birthday or an anniversary commemorating a special event or accomplishment. This money may be spent in advance of the special day for this rate.

## Appendix A: Design philosophies

The reasoning behind some of the decisions that went into designing this system may not be immediately apparent, so some of it is given in this section.

### A.1. Why are the rates like that?

The rates for exchanging credits were made under the assumption that it is possible to earn a substantial amount of credits in one day. If you slept well the previous night, put in 7 hours at work, and spent 4 hours developing yourself, you would earn 4 silver and 8 gold. That's a pretty full day, but there's still some time to socialize and relax.

#### A.1.1. Financial exchange rates for gold

In allowing credits to be exchanged for money, it was important to have the money be proportional to what you earn, or else the rate would be excessive or not enough.

In one day of work, you might earn 8 gold and spend 2 of it on time, leaving a remainder of 6 gold, and over a 5-day workweek that would be a net gain of 30 gold. Assuming an hourly wage of $20/hour and a rate of 1 gold per 5% of hourly wage, 30 gold would get you $30. In other words, you could treat yourself to something ≤$30 every week, or you could save up for a month to buy something ≤$120.

I set the rate of 5% because I don't want many things in the first place. This is well below the common advice that 20%-30% of your income should be spent on what you want. If, for you, 5% is too low or applying the rate after taxes is too harsh, feel free to increase the rate for your purposes.

#### A.1.2. Time exchange rates

From the outset, I knew that I wanted to have 1 hour correspond to 1 credit for simplicity. Early on, 30 minutes per 1 silver seemed reasonable, so that was set then.

If someone made the 4 silver and 8 gold from a day's worth of work as described in **Why are the rates like that?**, they have worked for 11 hours total. After working for 11 hours, they should be able to relax for at least 3 hours without spending more than 25% of their gold, which they should be able to save up because they can be exchanged for money.

This person might spend all of their silver for 2 hours of time immediately because it's not worth it to them to wait for a day when they would be worth more. To get that third hour, they shouldn't have to spend more than 2 gold. Dividing 60 minutes by 2 gold would result in a rate of 30 minutes per gold spent, which is the same as the rate for 1 silver. However, because gold is meant to be strictly better than silver, gold was set to be worth 45 minutes. So, the net time earned by spending 4 silver and 2 gold would be 3.5 hours, which I thought worked out well enough.

## Appendix B: Personalizing the system

This system is meant to incentivize you to do more of what you think that you should be doing. Each person's goals and priorities are different, and additional ways to earn credits can be made to achieve them.

For example, I included **Sleeping regularly** as a way to earn credits because I was struggling to commit to going to bed at a reasonable hour. Now that I'm rewarded in some way for it, I find it much easier, and I rarely turn in very late these days.

### B.1. When you're not paid by the hour

You may be paid an annual salary and not have an hourly wage. In this case, treat the average amount you make divided by your average number of worked hours in a typical week. So, if in an average week you work for 40 hours and make $1200, your hourly wage would be $30 an hour.

Then, because your income is not proportional to how long you worked, neither is your gold. You automatically earn a full day's worth of gold at the end of every workday, regardless of how long you worked.

### B.2. Earning credits with other goals

These are some examples of additional ways to earn credits. You should use these or make their own if you especially struggle to achieve a particular personal goal. For example, I don't use the **Exercising** one because I found a workout that I enjoy doing, so I don't need the extra push, but I would probably start using it if I wanted to start jogging.

#### B.2.1. Eating well

When you spend money buying healthy food, you earn 1 silver for every multiple of your hourly wage spent. So, if you make $20 an hour, you earn 2 silver from spending $40 on healthy food. Prototypical examples of healthy foods are most fruits, vegetables, and nuts. If you're unsure about whether something counts as healthy food, it probably doesn't.

Additionally, if you cook for yourself, time spent cooking healthy meals is considered **Developing yourself**.

Finally, when buying for yourself, healthy food is considered an expense, but food with no significant nutritional value is purchased using gold. Such food can be bought as an expense when used to cope after a very stressful event, but not at other times.

#### B.2.1. Exercising

When **Developing yourself** through exercise, you earn twice as many silver. In other words, you earn 2 silver for 1 hour of exercise, and you earn 1 silver for 30 minutes of exercise. Time spent warming up and cooling down counts towards earning silver.

### B.3. The labels used in this document

The labels that I use for most of the things specific to this document are unimportant. These things can be relabeled to whatever appeals to you most.

The most important labels for this are "silver" and "gold", which are basically arbitrary. You could very easily just call these "time credits" and "work credits", "red credits" and "blue credits", "sazh" and "yangi", or basically anything else.
