## <a name="introduction"></a>1. Introduction <a href="#table_of_contents">^</a>

This is a reference grammar for Nga'ō, formerly known as Ekhwachi, a constructed language (conlang) that appears as the main representative of its language family in a fictional setting that I work on from time to time. I am writing this grammar to have all of the information in one place, presented in a way that, hopefully, is enjoyable and interesting to read for someone interested in conlangs or linguistics in general. Nga'ō is very much an ongoing project, and while the core of the grammar is stable, much of the rest is in flux. Anything marked with '[?]' needs more attention and is likely to change. Also, the lexicon is severely underdeveloped (see: nonexistent), so strings of question marks are used in place of the words in examples for the time being.

This work is meant to be descriptive and not pedagogical, showing the language's structure rather than serving as a resource for a hypothetical learner. To that end, I will be using technical terminology whenever it would suit a particular description, but I will avoid using needlessly obscure terms. In terms of framework, I will just be using 'basic linguistic theory' so that this work is readable to a broad audience and will remain so even as contemporary theories change.

This document is divided into \ref{chap:texts} chapters, including this introduction. Chapter \ref{chap:overview} is a brief overview of the language's typology and speakers. Chapter \ref{chap:phonology} describes the phonology and the romanization used throughout this document. Chapters \ref{chap:nouns}, \ref{chap:verb_morphology}, and \ref{chap:adjectives} cover the morphology of nouns, verbs, and adjectives, respectively. Chapter \ref{chap:pronouns} deals with pronouns, chapter \ref{chap:articles} with articles. Chapter \ref{chap:prepositions_particles} discusses prepositions and particles. Chapter \ref{chap:numerals} describes numerals. Chapter \ref{chap:verb_phrases} covers verb phrases. Chapters \ref{chap:clausal_syntax} and \ref{chap:coordination} respectively deal with clausal syntax and coordination. Chapter \ref{chap:noun_incorporation} discusses noun incorporation, and chapter \ref{chap:relative_clauses} describes relative clauses. Chapter 16 covers derivation. Lastly, chapter \ref{chap:lexicon} deals with the lexicon, and chapter \ref{chap:texts} contains sample texts in Nga'ō, some original, others translations.

### <a name="language_goals"></a>1.1. Goals and use of the language <a href="#table_of_contents">^</a>

The primary goal of Nga'ō is naturalism. It is the first of 4 languages in its setting that I intend to flesh out, as well as my first conlang that is more than a sketch. To make it stand out from the other 3 languages, I have outlined some defining features of the grammar, most of which are described in more detail in chapter \ref{chap:overview}. With Nga'ō, I wanted to make a language that has:

* A high degree of morphological and syntactic ergativity, with a few exceptions;
* Extremely head-initial, as well as verb-initial, basic syntax;
* Morphosyntax that is generally analytics or head-marking, but not to the point of being polysynthetic;
* Relatively easy phonology and phonotactics;
* A degree of irregularity that is non-negligible but still manageable.

The main natural language inspirations for Nga'ō were Fijian and the Polynesian languages, as well as the Mayan languages, of which I most commonly referenced Tzotzil.

### <a name="language_use"></a>1.2. Use of the language <a href="#table_of_contents">^</a>

While the setting of Nga'ō has enough depth and history for writing fiction, I am not much of a writer, and I do not have any firm plans to write anything using it. I plan to use the language for fun, as well as to test natural language processing techniques, but I mostly just want it to exist so I can look at it and feel accomplished.

When the language and its setting are sufficiently developed, I plan to make an extended lexicon for it that contains words for concepts from our world so that I can use it more broadly in my own life without constantly running into lexical gaps. In particular, the technology in the setting is about as advanced as what our world had a millennium ago, so it is not possible to talk about anything from plastic to computers without an extended lexicon.

I consider all of the pre-expansion words and their senses 'official Nga'ō' and everything in the expanded lexicon 'unofficial Nga'ō'. Most of this extended lexicon is derived from existing words in Nga'ō through compounding, derivation, or metaphorical extension rather than borrowing, but for proper nouns and other words that cannot be derived, I borrowed words from an existing natural language. I paired each of my 4 main languages with a natural language for this purpose, and for Nga'ō, this language is Finnish. For example, after being filtered through the language's phonology, the Nga'ō words for Japan and Poland are respectively **Yapani** and **Puora**, from Finnish *Japani* and *Puola*.

### <a name="interlinear_glosses"></a>1.3. Interlinear glosses <a href="#table_of_contents">^</a>

The interlinear glosses used for examples in this work are basically consistent with the Leipzig Glossing Rules. They will be formatted like in the following example:

For example:

<pre>
????? nī ????? ???
??? -??      nī     ???   -??       ???
wait-1SG.ERG DEF.PL friend-3PL.POSS tomorrow
'I'll be waiting for their friends tomorrow'
</pre>

For clarity's sake, most of the time I will not divide the words in the second line into their constituent morphemes. When particular morphemes or words are being highlighted, they will be bolded; the following draws attention to the possessive suffix in the above example:

<pre>
????? nī ???<b>??</b> ???
??? -??      nī     ???   -<b>??</b>       ???
wait-1SG.ERG DEF.PL friend-</b>3PL.POSS</b> tomorrow
'I'll be waiting for </b>their</b> friends tomorrow'
</pre>

#### <a name="additional_conventions"></a>1.3.1. Additional conventions <a href="#table_of_contents">^</a>

Many sentences in Nga'ō can be interpreted in multiple ways out of context. Consider the following example:

<pre>
??????? ????? neng ??? ???
 ??-?? -???   ???=??      neng       ???   ???
PST-PFV-throw net=3SG.ABS LOC.DEF.SG water be.cold
'(He/she) cast (a/some) net(s) into the cold water'
</pre>

The gender of the thrower is ambiguous, and **[?]** 'net' in this case can be singular or plural. In this way, 'He cast a net into the cold water' and 'She cast some nets into the cold water' are both valid translations for the above gloss in the right context.

The parenthetical information in the fourth line makes it harder to read, so instead of using many parentheticals, I will be using the following conventions to make reading the glosses easier:

* Nouns will be translated as plural when their number is ambiguous.
* Human referents of unknown gender will be variously glossed as 'he', 'she', 'him', 'her', etc. Singular 'they/them' would also be appropriate but will be avoided in these translations for clarity.
* Many adjectives, such as **\[?\]** 'to be excited' and **\[?\]** 'to be hungry', are similar to stative verbs. These will be glossed without 'be' when being used attributively.

Below is the gloss from above written using these conventions:

</pre>
??????? ????? neng ??? ???
 ??-?? -???   ???=??      neng       ???   ???
PST-PFV-throw net=3SG.ABS LOC.DEF.SG water cold
'She cast nets into the cold water'
</pre>

Of course, these conventions will be ignored when necessary. When an example is being used to demonstrate some feature of the language, it will contain all of the information that it needs to do so.

#### <a name="terms_syntactic_arguments"></a>1.3.2. A note on terms for syntactic arguments <a href="#table_of_contents">^</a>

The term 'subject' is troublesome when describing ergative languages like Nga'ō. In this work, I will use the term 'subject/S' only for intransitive subjects, and I will use the term 'agent/A' for transitive subjects. Often, intransitive subjects and direct objects will pattern the same way, so I will also use the term 'patient/P' when they do. The table below summarizes how I will use terms for syntactic roles in this work.

| Term      | Symbol | Use                                   |
| --------- | ------ | ------------------------------------- |
| 'subject' | S      | subject of an intransitive verb       |
| 'agent'   | A      | subject of a transitive verb          |
| 'object'  | O      | direct object of an intransitive verb |
| 'patient' | P      | any absolutive argument (S or O)      |

When discussing semantic roles, I will use the terms 'agentive' and 'patientive' instead.

### <a name="abbreviations"></a>1.4. Abbreviations <a href="#table_of_contents">^</a>

|   |   |
| - | - |
| \- | separator for segmentable morphemes, e.g., English _walk-ed_ (walk-PST) |
| \~ | separator for a reduplicated element and its stem |
| = | clitic boundary, e.g., English _child='s_ (child=GEN) |
| . | separator for irreducible morphemes that are represented by multiple glosses, e.g., English _we_ (1PL.NOM). Not used between abbreviations for person and number, so 1PL is used for 1.PL,  2SG for 2.SG, etc., and 3PL.ERG is used for 3.PL.ERG, 3SG.ABS for 3.SG.ABS, etc. |
| : | separates morphemes where segmentation is irrelevant, usually for brevity |

## <a name="overview"></a>2. An overview of Nga'ō <a href="#table_of_contents">^</a>

### <a name="overview_introduction"></a>2.1. Introduction <a href="#table_of_contents">^</a>

This chapter provides an overview of Nga'ō, including the origins of the name of the language and the demographic information of its speakers, as well as descriptions of its various typological features.

### <a name="language_setting"></a>2.2. The language and its setting <a href="#table_of_contents">^</a>

#### <a name="language_name"></a>2.2.1. The name of the language and its language family <a href="#table_of_contents">^</a>

The language Nga'ō is a member of the **\[?\]** language family, along with its relatives Viñuviñu and Wabgūn. **Nga'ō** is the term that speakers of the language generally use to refer to themselves as a distinct ethnolinguistic group. As the name of their language, it is a clipping of **\[DEF.SG\] \[TONGUE\] Nga'ō** 'the Nga'ō language'. In this work, I will use the term for both the language and its speakers, and I will do the same for Viñuviñu and Wabgūn.

Within the **\[?\]** language family, Nga'ō and Viñuviñu form one branch while Wabgūn forms its own separate branch. Nga'ō and Viñuviñu are relatively closely related and are similar in most ways, though there are some fundamental differences in their syntax and discourse pragmatics in particular that cause mutual intelligibility to be low. Wabgūn, having been isolated from the other two for millennia, shares some lexical and morphological similarities with them, but they are otherwise vastly different.

#### <a name="ethnography_demography"></a>2.2.2. Ethnography and demography <a href="#table_of_contents">^</a>

Nga'ō is spoken by about **\[?\]** people on the island of Nakaya, which is roughly the size of the island of Ireland. Most speakers of Nga'ō are found in the southern part of Nakaya, along the eastern coast, and on an archipelago off of that coast. Most of the rest of the island is occupied by the Viñuviñu, while the Wabgūn live on a much smaller island to the southeast. The Nga'ō have no real long-term contact with the Wabgūn, but they have extensive contact and history with the Viñuviñu.

#### <a name="sociolinguistic_status"></a>2.2.3. Sociolinguistic status <a href="#table_of_contents">^</a>

Most Nga'ō are monolingual, with the exception of some communities near Viñuviñu-occupied regions. Neither group has had long-term contact with the Wabgūn, and there are no known cases of advanced multilingualism involving their language. There is no pidgin in common to both groups of speakers, and most communication with the Wabgūn has been limited to unstructured gesturing, so 'bilingualism' in this section refers to Nga'ō-Viñuviñu bilingualism only.

Geographically, bilingualism is most common in a Nga'ō enclave in the central region of the island, and it is virtually nonexistent in the heart of the southern region and on the eastern archipelago. Elsewhere, bilingualism is rare but not vanishingly so; it is somewhat more common among Nga'ō men, both because they tend to have lifestyles that involve more traveling, and because interethnic marriage more commonly involves a Nga'ō man and a Viñuviñu woman than vice versa, though even those marriages are rare in most communities. A number of Nga'ō who learn Viñuviñu as adults do so to a relatively high level of proficiency, but most tend to struggle with its foreign syntax and discourse pragmatics, and they tend to avoid constructions that don't also work in Nga'ō. Truly high proficiency in both languages is usually only achieved by those who were raised in bilingual households.

#### <a name="overview_dialects"></a>2.2.4. Dialects <a href="#table_of_contents">^</a>

Nga'ō has two large dialects and ten much smaller ones. In descending order by number of speakers, the dialects are: Southern, Mountain, Western, Central, Eastern, and the seven dialects spoken throughout the archipelago off the coast. In this work, I deal extensively only with the Southern dialect, which is spoken in a large southern portion of the island.

Some of the dialects differ only slightly, mostly phonologically and lexically, while others differ quite significantly. In particular, the Southern and Mountain dialects differ little, as do the archipelago dialects amongst themselves. However, the archipelago dialects as a group differ more markedly from the mainland dialects, and the Central dialect is very different from the all of the others due to heavy influence from Viñuviñu. I leave the details to the non-Southern dialects in Appendix **\[?\]**.

### <a name="overview_typology"></a>2.3. Overview of typological features <a href="#table_of_contents">^</a>

This section briefly details the features of Nga'ō that make it distinct from other languages. These include summaries of its phonology, morphology, and syntax, all of which are discussed in greater detail in their respective chapters.

#### <a name="overview_phonology"></a>2.3.1. Phonology and morphophonology <a href="#table_of_contents">^</a>

Nga'ō has 5 vowel phonemes, which consist of the cross-linguistically common set of /i, e, a, o, u/. Each may be long or short with no significant change in quality, and they have little allophonic variation. There are also four closing diphthongs: /ai̯, au̯, oi̯, eu̯/.

|       | Front | Central | Back |
| ----- | ----- | ------- | ---- |
| Close | i     |         | u    |
| Mid   | e     |         | o    |
| Open  |       | a       |      |

Figure A. _Vowels._

There are 11 consonant phonemes in 5 places of articulation (labial, coronal, palatal, velar, and glottal), which do not contrast in voicing, aspiration, secondary articulation, or length. The table below does not include additional allophones.

|                 | Labial | Coronal | Palatal | Velar | Glottal |
| --------------- | ------ | ------- | ------- | ----- | ------- |
| **Nasal**       | m      | n       |         | ŋ     |         |
| **Plosive**     | p      | t       |         | k     | ʔ       |
| **Fricative**   |        | s       |         |       |         |
| **Approximant** |        |         | j       | w     |         |
| **Tap**         |        | ɾ       |         |       |         |

Figure A. _Consonants (allophones omitted)._

Syllables in the language are of the form (C)V(C). V may be a short or long monophthong, or it may be a diphthong. The onset of the syllable may be any single consonant, and the coda may be a homorganic nasal, /s/, /ʔ/ (realized as \[h\]), or the first half of a geminate. Primary stress consistently falls on the last syllable of a word, including after derivation and affixation. However, there is a set of common postclitics that do not draw stress from the words they attach to.

The main word classes in Nga'ō are noun, verb, and adjective. Very many roots can be used as two or three of these classes (ex. **\[?\]** in isolation can mean 'death' or 'die'), but they can be distinguished by their syntactic behavior, and to a lesser degree by their morphology. These three word classes are open classes, while all other word classes are closed classes.

Verbs are either dynamic or stative, but the two subclasses have extensive overlap. Sometimes small changes in morphology or syntax can be used to identify a verb as one or the other, but at other times they are indistinguishable. Dynamic verbs refer to actions that involve changes of state, and they take the full range of verbal morphology. Stative verbs refer to unchanging states and are a subset of imperfective verbs, nearly all are derived from dynamic verbs, and they take a restricted subset of verbal morphology.

Adjectives have two subclasses, verbal and nominal, which closely resemble stative verbs and nouns, respectively. Whether an adjective is verbal or nominal is lexical, but in general, adjectives referring to more permanent or long-lasting states, such as **\[?\]** 'long', are nominal, while those referring to more transient states, such as **\[?\]** 'happy', are verbal. Verbal adjectives are essentially identical to stative verbs, except that they're not usually derived from dynamic verbs, they aren't marked for their arguments when used attributively, and they can be used adverbially without periphrasis. Nominal adjectives are likewise almost identical to nouns, except that they don't take articles when used predicatively, and they can be intensified with reduplication.

In pronouns, there are three persons and two numbers; third person pronouns are unrelated to demonstrative pronouns, which have a 3-way proximal/medial/distal distinction. Interrogative pronouns are morphologically identical to some indefinite pronouns, such that **\[?\]** in isolation can mean 'what' or 'something', for example.

There are only a small number of 'true' prepositions, which don't share any morphology with other parts of speech. Other prepositional functions are handled by relational nouns, which are grammatically possessed by other nouns to express spatial and temporal relationships, such as **\[LOC stomach LOC DEF.SG volcano]** 'inside the volcano' from **\[stomach\]** 'stomach'.

Other small word classes, all of which are closed, include articles, conjunctions, numerals, and particles. Particles include most uninflecting words that only have grammatical meaning, such as markers for negation, polar questions, focus, evidentiality, and relativization.

#### <a name="overview_morphology"></a>2.3.3. Morphology and morphosyntax <a href="#table_of_contents">^</a>

Most parts of speech in Nga'ō inflect rather little, with the exception of verbs. Most inflectional morphology is done with prefixes and a few suffixes, mostly agglutinative, though reduplication is also quite common. Noun incorporation is a highly productive morphological process.

##### 2.3.3.1. Inflectional morphology

Nouns have no inflectional morphology aside from a set of possessive suffixes. A noun's number is ambiguous in isolation, but it's commonly marked as singular or plural elsewhere in the phrase or clause, such as with definite articles.The table below lists the possessive suffixes. If a cell has two rows, the top row is the most common allomorph, and the bottom row are the other allomorphs. This allomorphy is explained further in the following subsections.

|                | Singular | Plural |
| -------------- | -------- | ------ |
| **1st person** | -ra <br> _-re, -ro, -ta_ | -'ang <br> _-ssang_ |
| **2nd person** |     -ong |    -mi |
| **3rd person** | -s <br> _-su, ssu_ | -pe <br> _-ppe_ |

Figure A. _Possessive suffixes._

| Nga'ō     | English                 | Nga'ō     | English               |
| --------- | ----------------------- | --------- | --------------------- |
| nī ???-?? | 'my hands'              | nī ???-?? | 'our hands'           |
| nī ???-?? | 'your (singular) hands' | nī ???-?? | 'your (plural) hands' |
| nī ???-?? | 'its hands'             | nī ???-?? | 'their hands'         |

If a noun's grammatical role is marked, it is marked by some combination of verbal marking, prepositions, and word order. Verbs agree with their A arguments, while P arguments are not marked on the verb if they appear in the clause as full NPs; they otherwise appear as clitics on the verb.

<pre>
????????? nī ??? <b>neng</b> ??? <b>???</b> nī ?????
 ??- ??-??? -??      nī     ???   <b>neng</b>       ???  <b>???</b> nī     ???  -??
PST-PFV-peel-3PL.ERG DEF.PL peach <b>LOC.DEF.SG</b> boat <b>ABL</b> DEF.PL knife-3PL.POSS
'They peeled the peaches on the boat with their knives'

Eng ??? ????????? eng <b>???</b>
eng    ???     ??- ??-??? -??      eng    <b>???</b>
DEF.SG hunter PST-PFV-kill-3SG.ERG DEF.SG <b>pheasant</b>
'The hunter killed the pheasant'

Eng ??? ????????? ???<b>??</b>
eng    ???     ??- ??-??? -??     =<b>??</b>
DEF.SG hunter PST-PFV-kill-3SG.ERG=<b>3SG.ABS</b>
'The hunter killed it'
</pre>

In addition to this marking of A and P, verbs inflect for tense, aspect, mood, and voice. The examples below show how some of these inflectional categories are realized.

|          |                          |         |                         |
| -------- | ------------------------ | ------- | ----------------------- |
| ?????    | 'It throws'              | ??????? | 'It wants to throw'     |
| ???????  | 'It will throw'          | ??????? | 'It throws (something)' |
| ???????  | 'It was throwing'        | ??????? | 'It throws for'         |
| ???????  | 'It throws (repeatedly)' | ?????   | 'Throw!'                |
| ???????? | 'It hurls'               |         |                         |

Figure A. _Examples of aspect, mood, and voice marking with the verb (?), 'to throw'._

Adjectives don't have unique morphology, instead sharing morphology with verbs or nouns. Aside from demonstratives and articles, which have number agreement, only nouns, verbs, and adjectives have inflectional or derivational morphology.

##### 2.3.3.2. Head- and dependent-marking

Nga'ō is predominantly head-marking, with pronominal P arguments and possessors being marked on verbs and possessed nouns, respectively. The verbal marking is admittedly not prototypical given the markers' status as anaphoric clitics rather than agreement affixes.

<pre>
????? ??? ??? ??? ???
???      -??      eng    ??? neng       ???
celebrate-3PL.ERG DEF.SG end LOC.DEF.SG journey
'They're celebrating the end of the journey'

?????<b>??</b>
???      -??     =<b>??</b>
celebrate-3PL.ERG=<b>3SG.ABS</b>
'They're celebrating it'

eng ???<b>??</b>
eng ???      -<b>??</b>
DEF.SG father-<b>1SG.POSS</b>
'my father'
</pre>

However, most other heads are unmarked, such as in adjective phrases and prepositional phrases. Dependent-marking is also found in some constructions, such as demonstratives agreeing in number with their head nouns, as well as in possession for non-pronominal possessors.

<pre>
Eng ??? <b>???</b>, nī ??? <b>???</b>
eng    ???   <b>???</b>  nī    ???   <b>???</b>
DEF.SG story <b>that</b> DEF.PL story <b>that.PL</b>
'that story, those stories'

Eng ??? <b>???</b>, ??? nī <b>???</b>
eng    ???    <b>???</b>  nī    ???    <b>???</b>
DEF.SG farmer <b>that</b> DEF.PL farmer <b>that.PL</b>
'that story, those stories'

Eng ??? <b>no</b> eng ???
eng    ???    <b>no</b> eng    ???
DEF.SG father <b>LOC</b> DEF.SG woman
'the woman's father'
</pre>

Relative clauses could also be considered dependent-marked, with the view that the referential noun in the dependent clause is being reduced to a pronoun or pronominal affix.

<pre>
Nī ??? ?????????<b>??</b> ???
nī     ???   ??- ??-??? -??     =<b>??</b>      ???
DEF.PL fish PST-PFV-hunt-1SG.ERG=<b>3PL.ABS</b> yesterday
'the fish that I caught yesterday'

Eng ??? ??????? ??? <b>???</b>
eng    ???      ??~???=??      ??? <b>???</b>
DEF.SG knife ANTIP~cut=1SG.ABS ABL <b>3SG</b>
'the knife that I cut with'
</pre>

##### 2.3.3.3. Morphosyntactic alignment

In terms of alignment, the language is thoroughly ergative-absolutive. Patterns of verbal person marking in Nga'ō are uniformly morphologically ergative.

<pre>
???????<b>??</b>
 ??- ??-???  =<b>??</b>
PST-PFV-sleep=<b>3SG.ABS</b>
'He slept'

???????<b>??</b><b>??</b>
 ??- ??-??? -<b>??</b>     =<b>??</b>
PST-PFV-wait-<b>1PL.ERG</b>=<b>3SG.ABS</b>
'We waited for him'

???????<b>??</b><b>??</b>
 ??- ??-??? -<b>??</b>     =<b>??</b>
PST-PFV-wait-<b>3SG.ERG</b>=<b>1PL.ABS</b>
'He waited for us'
</pre>

There is no case marking, and when there are multiple explicit arguments, their roles are usually made clear through word order.

<pre>
????? eng ??? eng ???
???  -??      eng    ???    eng    ???
chase-3SG.ERG DEF.SG jaguar DEF.SG hunter
'The jaguar is chasing the hunter'

????? eng ??? eng ???
???  -??      eng    ???    eng    ???
chase-3SG.ERG DEF.SG hunter DEF.SG jaguar
'The hunter is chasing the jaguar'
</pre>

The language is also syntactically ergative, treating A and P arguments differently in relativization. An A argument cannot be relativized directly; it must first be promoted to an S argument using the antipassive voice, which can be seen in the examples below.

##### 2.3.3.4. Relativization

<pre>
Eng ??? ??? ???
eng    ???   ??? ???
DEF.SG metal COP heavy
'(The) metal is heavy'

??????? eng ??? ???
 ??-??? -??      eng    ???  ???
PST-open-3SG.ERG DEF.SG door rock
'She was opening the stone door'

Eng    ???  ???   ?????????
eng    ???  ???   ??-??? -??     =??
DEF.SG door rock PST-open-3SG.ERG=3SG.ABS
'the stone door that she was opening'

Eng ??? ??<b>??</b>????? ??? eng ??? ???
eng    ???    ??-   <b>??</b>~??? =??      ??? eng    ???  ???
DEF.SG woman PST-<b>ANTIP</b>~open=3SG.ABS ABL DEF.SG door rock
'the woman who was opening the stone door'

* Eng ??? ??????? eng ??? ???
  eng    ???    ??-??? -??      eng    ???  ???
  DEF.SG woman PST-open-3SG.ERG DEF.SG door rock
  Intended: 'the woman who was opening the stone door'
</pre>

##### 2.3.3.5. Coordination

Non-topicalized arguments usually coordinate ergatively.

<pre>
????????? eng ??? <b>eng ???</b> ???  ???????????
 ??- ??-???-??      eng    ???    <b>eng    ???</b>   ???  ??- ??- ??-??? =??
PST-PFV-see-3SG.ERG DEF.SG lizard <b>DEF.SG crane</b> and PST-PFV-MED-stop=3SG.ABS
'The lizard saw the crane and it (the crane) stopped'
</pre>

However, topicalized arguments generally pattern accusatively; a topicalized S or A coordinates as an S or A in a second clause.

<pre>
<b>Eng ???</b> ????????? eng ??? ???  ???????????
<b>eng  ???</b>  ??-  ??-???-??      eng    ???   ???  ??- ??- ??-??? =??
<b>DEF.SG lizard</b> PST-PFV-see-3SG.ERG DEF.SG crane and PST-PFV-MED-stop=3SG.ABS
'The lizard saw the crane and it (the lizard) stopped'
</pre>

S and A arguments, but not O arguments, can be topicalized without being marked morphologically or prosodically. Below, **\[?\]** in the second example are not overtly marked when topicalized, while the **\[?\]** in the third example has an additional prosodic pause and is now marked on the verb.

<pre>
????? nī ??? eng ???
???-??      nī     ??? eng    ???
eat-3PL.ERG DEF.PL rat DEF.SG ginger.root
'The rats are eating the ginger!'

<b>Nī ???</b> ????? eng ???
<b>nī     ???</b> ???-??      eng    ???
<b>DEF.PL rat</b> eat-3PL.ERG DEF.SG ginger.root
'The rats are eating the ginger!'

Eng ???, ?????<b>??</b> nī ???
eng    ???         ???-??     =<b>??</b>      nī     ???
DEF.SG ginger.root eat-3PL.ERG=<b>3SG.ABS</b> DEF.PL rat
'The rats are eating the ginger!'
</pre>

These restrictions on topicalizable arguments, and their behavior in coordination, are the only instances of nominative-accusative alignment in Nga'ō.

#### <a name="overview_syntax"></a>2.3.4. Syntax <a href="#table_of_contents">^</a>

Word order in Nga'ō is overwhelmingly head-initial, both at the phrase level and the clause level. The head noun of a noun phrase precedes any adjectives, numerals, demonstratives, genitives, and relative clauses that modify it, all adpositions are prepositions, and verbs generally precede their arguments.

The default word order is verb-agent-object (VAO) for transitive verbs and verb-subject (VS) for intransitive verbs, though AVO and SV are also common in discourse due to topicalization.

<pre>
??????? nī ???
 ??- ??-???  nī     ???
PST-PFV-wake DEF.PL girl
'The girls woke up'

<b>Nī ???</b> ???????
<b>nī   ???</b>     ??- ??-???
<b>DEF.PL girl</b> PST-PFV-wake
'The girls woke up'

??????? eng ??? wa ???
 ??-??? -??      eng    ???   wa      ???
PST-hold-3SG.ERG DEF.SG child INDF.SG rock
'The child was holding a rock'

<b>Eng ???</b> ??????? wa ???
<b>eng    ???</b>    ??-??? -??      wa      ???
<b>DEF.SG child</b> PST-hold-3SG.ERG INDF.SG rock
'The child was holding a rock'
</pre>

Similarly, AVO, OVA and SV orders result from an argument being focused, which is additionally marked with the preceding particle **\[?\]**. The order AOV occurs when A is topicalized and O is focused.

<pre>
??????? eng ??? ??? eng ???
 ??- ??-???  eng    ???       ??? eng    ???
PST-PFV-fall DEF.SG pineapple ABL DEF.SG table
'The pineapple fell off of the table'

<b>??? eng ???</b> ??????? ??? eng ???
<b>??? eng    ???</b>       ??- ??-???   ??? eng    ???
<b>FOC DEF.SG pineapple</b> PST-PFV-fall ABL DEF.SG table
'<b>The pineapple</b> fell off of the table'

??????????? eng ??? nī ????? ???
 ??- ??-??? -??  -??      eng    ???  nī     ???  -??       ???
PST-PFV-burn-CAUS-3SG.ERG DEF.SG fire DEF.PL glove-3SG.POSS new
'The fire burned her new gloves'

<b>??? eng ???</b> ??????????? nī ????? ???
<b>??? eng    ???</b>   ??- ??-??? -??  -??      nī     ???  -??       ???
<b>FOC DEF.SG fire</b> PST-PFV-burn-CAUS-3SG.ERG DEF.PL glove-3SG.POSS new
'<b>The fire</b> burned her new gloves'

<b>??? nī ????? ???</b> ??????????? eng ???
<b>??? nī     ???  -??       ???</b>  ??- ??-??? -??  -??      eng    ???
<b>FOC DEF.PL glove-3SG.POSS new</b> PST-PFV-burn-CAUS-3SG.ERG DEF.SG fire
'The fire burned <b>her new gloves</b>'

<b>Eng ???</b> <b>??? nī ????? ???</b> ???????????
<b>eng    ???</b>  <b>??? nī     ???  -??       ???</b>  ??- ??-??? -??  -??
<b>DEF.SG fire</b> <b>FOC DEF.PL glove-3SG.POSS new</b> PST-PFV-burn-CAUS-3SG.ERG
'The fire burned <b>her new gloves</b>'
</pre>

It is worth noting that focus constructions can be syntactically ambiguous; the second- and third-to-last examples have the exact same structure, and both could alternatively mean 'Her new gloves burned the fire' if the number agreement on the verb matched. Number agreement, context, and semantics normally prevent such nonsensical readings, so this ambiguity is rarely a problem in practice.

Interrogative words in nonpolar questions are fronted to the beginning of the sentence, only following a topicalized element if one is present. When an interrogative word is part of a larger phrase, the entire phrase is fronted.

<pre>
<b>???</b> ???????
<b>???</b>    ??-   ??~???
<b>who</b> DESID-ANTIP~help
'Who wants to help?'

<b>???</b> ????????? ???
<b>???</b>  ??- ??-???-??      ???
<b>who</b> PST-PFV-cut-3SG.ERG this
'Who cut this?'

<b>???</b> ?????
<b>???</b>  ???-??
<b>what</b> eat-2SG.ERG
'What are you eating?'

<b>???</b> ????????? eng ???
<b>???</b>    ??- ??-??? -??      eng    ???
<b>where</b> PST-PFV-find-3PL.ERG DEF.SG cave
'Where did your cousins find the cave?'

<b>??? ???</b> ?????????
<b>??? ???</b>   ??-??? -??     =??
<b>ABL what</b> PFV-make-3PL.ERG=3SG.ABS
'What will they make it with?'

<b>No ???</b> ??? eng ??? ???
<b>no ???</b>   ??? eng    ???   ???
<b>LOC what</b> COP DEF.SG canoe this
'Whose canoe is this?'

Eng ??? no <b>???</b> ?????????
eng    ???   no  <b>???</b>  ??- ??- ??-???
DEF.SG house LOC <b>who</b> PST-PFV-MED-burn
'Whose house is burning?'
</pre>

This fronting has the same potential for ambiguity as in focus constructions.


## <a name="phonology"></a>3. Phonology <a href="#table_of_contents">^</a>

### <a name="phonology_introduction"></a>3.1. Introduction <a href="#table_of_contents">^</a>

This chapter is an overview of the phonology of Nga'ō. I first describe the consonants and their allophonic variation before doing the same for vowels, then I describe stress rules and phonotactics. At the end of this chapter, I provide some evidence for my analysis of the inventory.

Nga'ō has its own orthography, but in this work it will be represented with a romanization. The romanization for phonemes will be noted in the tables of its consonant and vowel inventories. If the same symbols are used to represent a phoneme in the IPA and the romanization, they are not repeated. Otherwise, the IPA symbols are on the left, and the symbols used in the romanization are on the right in angle brackets.

### <a name="consonants"></a>3.2. Consonants <a href="#table_of_contents">^</a>

The 11 consonant phonemes of Nga'ō have the following places and manners of articulation. The 3 additional consonants in parentheses only appear as allophones.

|                 | Labial | Coronal | Post-alveolar | Palatal | Velar   | Glottal |
| --------------- | ------ | ------- | ------------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
| **Nasal**       | m      | n       |               | ŋ ⟨ng⟩   |         |         |
| **Plosive**     | p      | t       | (t͡ʃ ⟨ch⟩)      |         | k       | ʔ       |
| **Fricative**   |        | s       | (ʃ ⟨sh⟩)       | (ç ⟨h⟩)  | (x ⟨h⟩) | (h ⟨h⟩)  |
| **Approximant** |        | (l ⟨r⟩)  |               | j ⟨y⟩    | w       |         |
| **Tap**         |        | ɾ ⟨r⟩    |               |         |         |         |

Figure A. _Consonant phonemes._

#### <a name="allophony_consonants"></a>3.2.1. Allophonic variation in consonants <a href="#table_of_contents">^</a>

All uses of 'before' and 'after' in the descriptions below refer to segments that are immediately adjacent. For example, the second-to-last rule specifies that /tiku/ would be realized as \[t͡ʃiku\], but /tuki/ would be realized as \[tuki\] and not *\[t͡ʃuki\].

- A nasal coda assimilates in place with a following consonant, including across word boundaries. It is realized as \[m\] before /m, p/, \[n\] before /n, t, s, ɾ, j/, and \[ŋ\] before /ŋ, k, w, ʔ/, and word-finally.
- The default realizations of /n/ and /t/ are dental \[n̪\] and \[t̪\]. /t/ and /s/ palatalize before before /i/, becoming palato-alveolar \[t͡ʃ\] and \[ʃ\] respectively.
- The sequence /sj/, which occurs at syllable boundaries, is realized as \[ʃ\]. The same is not observed for */tj/ because that sequence does not occur.
- The glottal stop /ʔ/ is allophonically realized as \[ç ~ x ~ h\] in coda position. It is realized as /ç/ after /i/ and before /j/; otherwise it is realized as \[x ~ h\] in free variation, with \[x\] being somewhat more common.
- /ɾ/ is realized as \[l̪\] word-initially, as well as after nasals and /h/. Otherwise, it is realized as \[ɾ\] before front vowels, and it may be realized as \[ɾ\] or \[l̪\] before back vowels in free variation. Its realization as \[ɾ\] is always alveolar.
- The geminate affricate \[t͡ʃː\] is pronounced with its stop portion doubled rather than its fricative.
- The sequence /ŋi/ is realized as \[ni\].

#### <a name="romanization_consonants"></a>3.2.2. Romanization notes for consonants <a href="#table_of_contents">^</a>

- Nasal codas are always romanized to reflect their surface realizations in isolation, even if they would change across word boundaries. For example, the definite article is romanized as ⟨eng⟩, even when pronounced as \[en\] as in **eng tushi** 'the water' or **eng i\[?\]** 'the ???'}, or \[em\] as in **eng puh** 'the cut'. Additionally, the sequence \[ŋk\] is romanized as ⟨ngk⟩, as in **tangki** 'squid'.
- The allophonic palatalization of /t/ and /s/ before /i/, and the realization of /sj/ as \[ʃ\], are indicated in the romanization. \[t͡ʃ\] and \[ʃ\] are respectively romanized as ⟨ch⟩ and ⟨sh⟩.
- Geminates are romanized by doubling the symbol for the consonant. In the case of digraphs, the first is doubled, as in ⟨pp⟩, ⟨nng⟩, and ⟨cch⟩ for /pː/, /ŋː/, and \[t͡ʃː\].
- The sequence \[ni\] is romanized as ⟨ni⟩ regardless of whether it is underlyingly /ni/ or /ŋi/, except across word boundaries.
- When /ɾ/ is mandatorily realized as \[l̪\], it is romanized as ⟨l⟩.

### <a name="vowels"></a>3.3. Vowels <a href="#table_of_contents">^</a>

Nga'ō has the following 5 vowel phonemes. Each may be long or short with no significant change in quality.

|       | Front | Central | Back |
| ----- | ----- | ------- | ---- |
| Close | i     |         | u    |
| Mid   | e     |         | o    |
| Open  |       | a       |      |

Figure A. _Vowel phonemes._

In addition to the above monophthongs, there are four diphthongs: /ai̯/, /au̯/, /oi̯/, and /eu̯̯/. The diphthongs /ei̯/ and /ou̯/ are notably absent; they were also present until relatively recently, when they respectively simplified to /eː/ and /oː/. The remaining four are analyzed as diphthongs here because the two portions are not broken by stress or pauses; they are stressed or unstressed together as a unit, and they count as one syllable for the purpose of stress assignment. Phonemically, diphthongs are bimoraic and are equivalent to long vowels for most purposes.

#### <a name="allophony_vowels"></a>3.3.1. Allophonic variation in vowels <a href="#table_of_contents">^</a>

The vowels /e/ and /o/ are pronouced as \[e, o\] in stressed syllables and as \[e ~ ɛ\] and \[o ~ ɔ\] in unstressed syllables in free variation.

#### <a name="romanization_vowels"></a>3.3.2. Romanization notes for vowels <a href="#table_of_contents">^</a>

- Unstressed /e/ and /o/ are respectively romanized as ⟨e⟩ and ⟨o⟩, and those symbols will also be used in broad transcription.
- Long vowels are written with macrons: /iː/ as ⟨ī⟩, /aː/ as ⟨ā⟩, etc.
- The diphthongs /au̯/, /ai̯/, /oi̯/, and /eu̯̯/ are romanized as sequences of vowels: ⟨au⟩, ⟨ai⟩, ⟨oi⟩, and ⟨eu⟩.

### <a name="phonotactics"></a>3.4. Phonotactics <a href="#table_of_contents">^</a>

Nga'ō phonotactics are relatively. A syllable can have an onset of up to one consonant, and its nucleus can be a short or long monophthong or a diphthong. Syllables may end with /h/, /s/, or /ŋ/, and all non-glottal occlusives and sibilants can be geminated word-internally. In addition, the sequences /ji, je, wu, wo/ do not occur.

#### <a name="glottal_stop_insertion"></a>3.4.1. Glottal stop insertion <a href="#table_of_contents">^</a>

An epenthetic glottal stop is added to the beginning of words that phonemically begin with vowels. This glottal stop is phonetically indistinguishable from a phonemic glottal stop, but the two are distinguished by their different morphological behavior. In particular, words beginning with a phonemic glottal stop are always treated as beginning with consonants, while words beginning with epenthetic glottal stops are sometimes treated as starting with vowels.

### <a name="prosody"></a>3.5. Prosody <a href="#table_of_contents">^</a>

#### <a name="syllable_weight"></a>3.5.1. Syllable weight <a href="#table_of_contents">^</a>

Each syllable in Nga'ō is either light or heavy, which is determined by how many moras it contains. This distinction is mostly important for poetic purposes rather than for things such as stress assignment.

A (C)V sequence is one mora and is a light syllable, while every other syllable shape is a heavy syllable. The sequences CVV and CVC are both two moras, and the longest possible syllable, CVVC, is three moras. All of these can be broken down into CV, V, and C moras, as summarized in the table below.

#### <a name="word_stress"></a>3.5.2. Word stress <a href="#table_of_contents">^</a>

Stress in Nga'ō is predictable and not lexically phonemic. Primary stress falls on the last syllable of a word after inflection and derivation. Secondary stress falls on every preceding alternate syllable such that the syllable with primary stress is never adjacent to one with secondary stress. Stressed and unstressed syllables of the same weight have roughly the same duration and volume, with the greatest difference between them being pitch.

While inflectional and derivational suffixes attract stress, clitics do not. These include the absolutive clitics as well as the applicative marker.

### <a name="morphophonology"></a>3.6. Morphophonology <a href="#table_of_contents">^</a>

This section describes the morphophonological processes of the language that surface as a result of affixation and compounding. Because the limited phonotactics prevent consonant clusters, assimilatory processes mostly involve vowels and other segments.

#### <a name="vowel_raising"></a>3.6.1. Vowel raising <a href="#table_of_contents">^</a>

There is a morphophonological process whereby short /a/ sometimes becomes /e/ or /o/, or short /e, o/ become /i, u/. This happens most frequently with the ergative/possessive suffixes, as well as the causative suffix. Less commonly, /e, o/ may raise to /i, u/ based on whether or not they occur in light syllables. This process only occurs when attaching suffixes, not prefixes or clitics.

##### 3.6.1.1. Raising from /a/ or /e, /o/

Short /a/ in a light syllable immediately following /i(ː), u(ː)/ becomes /e, o/. This syllable is the last in the stem or the word. The simplest case of this is with the first person singular ergative/possessive suffix, which by default is **-ra** (ex. **tanga**: **tanga-ra**) but has the allomorphs **-re** and **-ro**. For example, the words **tanga** 'woman, wife', **ani** '\[?\]', and **kasnu** '\[?\]' have the possessive forms **tanga-r<ins>a</ins>**, **ani-r<ins>e</ins>**, and **kansu-r<ins>o</ins>**.

For the first person singular suffix in particular, this allomorphy always occurs and is completely predictable based on the preceding vowel. It is the only suffix where the vowel changes because it happens to be the only one where the suffix is a light syllable containing a short /a/.

Otherwise, the most common instance of this raising is that the word has already undergone this process, but it is undone when most suffixes are added. For example, **chine** '\[?\]' and **tūso** '\[?\]' become **chin<ins>a</ins>-ra** and **tūs<ins>a</ins>-ra** with the same suffix.

##### 3.6.1.2. Raising from /e, o/ to /i, u/

Short /e, o/ in stem-final syllables sometimes become /i, u/ after attaching suffixes if they are still in light syllables after inflection. This primarily happens with the second person singular ergative/possessive suffix and the causative suffix. For example, **shio** 'paint' has the forms **shios-su** 'his/her/its paint' and **shi<ins>u</ins>-tong** 'your (sg.) paint'. This occurs in a few inflection classes: one for words where there is a consonant in the stem that is absent in the base form but which surfaces when adding suffixes, and one for words ending in **-eng** or **-ong**.

##### 3.6.1.3. Patterns of raising

The examples below illustrate the main patterns of raising, including the case where no raising happens at all.

|   | Lemma | 1SG.ERG | 2SG.ERG | 3SG.ERG | CAUS | MED + 3SG.ABS |
| - | ----- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ---- | ------------- |
| **No raising** | tanga | tanga-ra | tango-ong | tanga-s | - | - |
| **Undone: /a/ to /e/** | chin<ins>e</ins> | china-ra | chino-ong | china-s | china-ih | wan-chin<ins>e</ins>=ki |
| **1SG only: /a/ to /o/** | kasnu | kasnu-r<ins>o</ins> | kasno-ong | kasnu-s | kasn-ih | wang-kasnu=ki |
| **-eng: /e/ to /i/** | uneng | unen-ta | un<ins>i</ins>n-ong | unen-su | un<ins>i</ins>n-ih | wan-uneng=ki |
| **-o: /o/ to /u/** | shio | shio-ra | shi<ins>u</ins>t-ong | shios-su | shi<ins>u</ins>ch-ih | wan-shio=ki |

##### 3.6.1.4. Diachronic origin

This process arose from a sound change where /a/ raised after stressed /i(ː)/ and /u(ː)/. For example, modern **uto** at the time was pronounced \[ˈu.ða\] and then became \[ˈu.ðo\]. This change in vowel quality remained after another sound change where stress shifted to the last syllable of the word. The old vowel resurfaces in forms like **uta-ra** because the presence of those suffixes had shifted the stress to the right (at the time, \[u.ˈða.ɾa\]), so the vowel-raising sound change did not apply to those forms.

The explanation is similar for the first person singular ergative/possessive suffix: the vowel raised when it was after stressed /i(ː)/ and /u(ː)/, before the stress later shifted. The first person plural ergative/possessive suffix **-'ang** also has short /a/, but it does not vary as in the singular because it is and was a closed syllable, which meant that stress was already on that syllable at the time of the sound change (\[ˌu.ða.ˈhaŋ\]).

In the cases where /e, o/ raise to /i, u/, there was historically a sound change where /i, u/ lowered to /e, o/ before nasal codas. This was prevented if the syllable happened to be opened through the addition of a suffix beginning with a vowel, as happens for the second person singular and causative forms.

From a diachronic perspective, it would be more accurate to call this lowering rather than raising, but I grouped these together under 'raising' because it appears that way synchronically and is easier to explain.


## <a name="nouns"></a>4. Nouns and noun phrases <a href="#table_of_contents">^</a>

### <a name="nouns_introduction"></a>4.1. Introduction <a href="#table_of_contents">^</a>

Nouns in Nga'ō have little inflectional morphology, only having a set of possessive suffixes. They do not inflect for number or definiteness, which is instead marked on other words in the phrase and/or clause, especially on articles.

### <a name="number_definiteness"></a>4.2. Number and definiteness <a href="#table_of_contents">^</a>

Nouns do not inflect for number or definiteness, which is instead indicated with articles and/or demonstratives in the same phrase. All nouns other than pronouns, including proper nouns, almost always obligatorily occur with articles, so number and definiteness are almost always clear in practice.

<pre>
Eng/wa/nī/??? ???
eng/   wa/     nī/    ???     ???
DEF.SG/INDF.SG/DEF.PL/INDF.PL crane
'the/a/some crane(s)'
</pre>

When a noun occurs with a demonstrative, it usually occurs with a definite article.

<pre>
<b>Eng</b> ??? <b>???</b>, <b>nī</b> ??? <b>???</b>
<b>eng</b>    ???   <b>???</b>     <b>nī</b>     ???   <b>???</b>
<b>DEF.SG</b> smith <b>this.SG</b> <b>DEF.PL</b> smith <b>those</b>
'this smith, those smiths'
</pre>

Nouns only occur without articles in two constructions. When a noun is incorporated, it is not modified in any way, including by articles.

<pre>
??? ??????????? ??? ???
???   ??- ??-  ??~???   -??     eng    ???
then PST-PFV-INTS~close-3SG.ERG DEF.SG door
'Then he slammed the door'

??? ????????? ?????
???   ??- ??-  ??~???   ??? =??
then PST-PFV-INTS~close door=3SG.ABS
'Then he slammed the door'
</pre>

Otherwise, articles do not occur with nouns when they are modified by indefinite or interrogative pronouns.

<pre>
??? ????????? wa ???
???  ??- ??-???-??      wa      ???
Q   PST-PFV-use-2SG.ERG INDF.SG hammer
'Did you use a hammer?'

??? <b>???</b> ?????????
???    <b>???</b>   ??- ??-???-??
hammer <b>what</b> PST-PFV-use-2SG.ERG
'Which hammer did you use?'
</pre>

### <a name="possessive_suffixes"></a>4.3. Possessive suffixes <a href="#table_of_contents">^</a>

There are two constructions used in possessive phrases, based on whether the possessor is pronominal or a common noun. When the possessor is pronominal, the possessed noun takes one of the following possessive suffixes, which agree in person and number with the possessor.

The table below summarizes the suffixes for all persons and numbers. Except for the second person forms, these exhibit a significant amount of allomorphy. If a cell has two rows, the top row is the most common allomorph, and the bottom row are the other allomorphs. This allomorphy is explained further in the following subsections.

|                | Singular | Plural |
| -------------- | -------- | ------ |
| **1st person** | -ra <br> _-re, -ro, -ta_ | -'ang <br> _-ssang_ |
| **2nd person** |     -ong |    -mi |
| **3rd person** | -s <br> _-su, ssu_ | -pe <br> _-ppe_ |

<pre>
eng ???<b>??</b>
eng    ??? -<b>??</b>
DEF.SG bowl-<b>3SG.POSS</b>
'her bowl'

nī ???<b>??</b>
nī     ???    -<b>??</b>
DEF.PL machete-<b>3PL.POSS</b>
'their machetes'
</pre>

When the possessor is a common noun, it occurs after the possessed noun as the object of the preposition **no** or its portmanteau forms **neng**/**na**.

<pre>
nī ??? <b>no</b> eng ???
nī     ???  <b>no</b>  eng    ???
DEF.PL claw <b>LOC</b> DEF.SG crab
'the crab's claws'

nī ??? <b>no</b> nī ???
nī     ???      <b>no</b>  nī     ???
DEF.PL position <b>LOC</b> DEF.PL army
'the positions of the armies'

nī ??? <b>neng</b> ?????
nī     ???  <b>neng</b>       ???-??
DEF.PL aunt <b>LOC.DEF.SG</b> man-1SG.POSS
'my husband's aunts'
</pre>

#### <a name="erg_2sg_ablaut"></a>4.3.1. Ablaut from second person singular '-ong' <a href="#table_of_contents">^</a>

Most of these suffixes are agglutinative and attach transparently and simply to the stem, but the second person singular suffix **-ong** sometimes causes vowel changes in the stem. Namely, in stems ending in short **-a** or **-u** (and less frequently **-e**), that vowel assimilates into an **-o**, creating a long vowel.

#### <a name="erg_1st_allomorphy"></a>4.3.2. Allomorphy in the first person <a href="#table_of_contents">^</a>

The most common realization for the first person singular suffix is **-ra**, but due to the raising rule mentioned in [3.6.1.](#vowel_raising), it often surfaces as **-re** or **-ro** if the preceding syllable contains /i(ː)/ or /u(ː)/. After nasal codas, it surfaces as **-ta**.

For the first personal plural, the basic form of the suffix is **-'ang**. It surfaces as **-ssang** if the stem ends in a non-nasal coda, replacing that consonant.

#### <a name="erg_2nd_allomorphy"></a>4.3.3. Allomorphy in the second person <a href="#table_of_contents">^</a>

The second person suffixes exhibit basically no allomorphy. That said, some words have a stem-final consonant that surfaces before the second person singular suffix, which can complicate its formation. This stem consonant is lexical and unpredictable.

#### <a name="erg_3rd_allomorphy"></a>4.3.4. Allomorphy in the third person <a href="#table_of_contents">^</a>

The third person singular suffix is **-s** for stems ending in vowels, **-su** for stems ending **-ng**, and **-ssu** for stems ending in another consonant. This other consonant may be **-h** or **-s**, or it might be a **-(p/t/k)** that only surfaces in some inflectional forms; in both cases, **-ssu** replaces the final consonant.

The third person plural suffix is normally **-pe**. It surfaces as **-ppe** in the same circumstances in which the third person singular suffix surfaces as **-ssu**.

#### <a name="erg_allomorphy_patterns"></a>4.3.5. Some useful patterns in allomorphy <a href="#table_of_contents">^</a>

The first person singular suffixes are completely predictable based on the shape of the lemma, and the second person plural suffix is invariant. The first person plural and third person suffixes have a fair amount of allomorphy, but because they are all just based on stem-final coda consonants, there are only a few combinations of them that exist:

* **-ssu**, **-ssang**, **-ppe**. Occurs for stems ending in **-h/p/t/k**, which in many cases is a consonant that only occurs during inflection. These suffixes replace the stem consonant.
* **-su**, **-sang**, **-pe**. Occurs for stems ending in **-s**, not replacing it.
* **-su**, **-'ang**, **-pe**. Occurs for stems ending in **-ng**, not replacing it.
* **-s**, **-'ang**, **-pe**. Occurs for stems ending in a vowel. This does not include stems ending in a silent consonant that were mentioned in the first bullet point.

The stem changes that occur with the second person singular suffix cannot be categorized as easily, but the main generalization is that a stem-final short **-a**, **-u**, and **-e** always assimilate, but the presence of a silent consonant prevents this assimilation.

### <a name="noun_phrases"></a>4.4. Noun phrase structure <a href="#table_of_contents">^</a>

The order of words in a noun phrase that has all possible modifiers is given below. All of these modifiers always come in this order.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Article</th>
    <th>Noun</th>
    <th>Adjective phrase</th>
    <th>Numeral phrase</th>
    <th>Demonstrative</th>
    <th>Possessor</th>
    <th>Prepositional phrase</th>
    <th>Relative clause</th>
  </tr>
</table>

The example below demonstrates what it looks like when all possible modifiers are used at once, which due to its complexity and specificity is mostly hypothetical.

<pre>
Nī ??? ??? ??? ??? na ??? neng ??? ?????????
nī     ???    ???   ???   ???     na          ???  neng       ???       ??- ??-???=??
DEF.PL branch heavy three this.PL LOC.INDF.SG tree LOC.DEF.SG river PST-PFV-fall=3PL.ABS
'these three heavy branches of a tree in the river, which fell'
</pre>

It can only be the branches that fell and not the tree or the river because of the plural number agreement on the verb. However, like English, the attachment of the prepositional phrase is ambiguous, so it is unclear whether the branches or the tree are in the river. Also, when both a genitive and a relative clause are present, it may be ambiguous as to whether the latter is modifying the genitive or the head of the noun phrase if verb agreement does not clarify.

<pre>
nī ??? no nī ??? ?????
nī     ???  no  nī     ???   ???         =??
DEF.PL face LOC DEF.PL woman be.beautiful=3PL.ABS
'the faces of the woman who are beautiful', or 'the women's faces that are beautiful'
</pre>

### <a name="noun_phrases_articles"></a>4.4.1. Articles <a href="#table_of_contents">^</a>

Before the rest of the noun phrase, a noun is almost always preceded by an article, which marks the noun's number and definiteness. The articles that are used here include:

- The definite articles **eng** and **nī**
- The indefinite articles **wa** and **\[?\]**
- The proper article **e**

### <a name="noun_phrases_adjectives"></a>4.4.2. Adjectives <a href="#table_of_contents">^</a>

Attributive adjectives always occur after the nouns they modify. Within the adjective phrase, nominal adjectives precede verbal adjectives, and words that modify adjectives occur after them.

### <a name="noun_phrases_numerals_demonstratives"></a>4.4.3. Numerals and demonstratives <a href="#table_of_contents">^</a>

Both numerals and demonstratives occur after the nouns they modify, in that order.

### <a name="noun_phrases_prepositionals"></a>4.4.4. Possessors and prepositional phrases <a href="#table_of_contents">^</a>

Common nouns possessing the head noun are placed after the head noun, separated by the preposition **no** or its portmanteau forms **neng**/**na**. In a structurally similar way, attributive prepositional phrases follow the head noun.

If the preposition is **no**, the reading can be ambiguous. For example. **\[??? ??? no ??? ???\]** can mean 'the water in the lake' or 'the water of the lake'.

### <a name="noun_phrases_relative_clauses"></a>4.4.5. Relative clauses <a href="#table_of_contents">^</a>


## <a name="verb_morphology"></a>5. Verb morphology <a href="#table_of_contents">^</a>

### <a name="verb_morphology_introduction"></a>5.1. Introduction <a href="#table_of_contents">^</a>

This chapter covers verbal morphology in more detail. This morphology is the most complex of all parts of speech by far, as verbs agreeing with A arguments in person and number, and inflect for tense, aspect, mood, voice, as well as a few minor categories. Verbs also serve as hosts for clitics for the applicative voice and pronominal P arguments.
<!--
\[in describing different classes of verbs, it should be mentioned that 'to see' and 'to hear', currently, are stative in that they don't take aspect morphology; at least in Mopan, 'to hear' is transitive, but it still takes aspect marking, so this might not hold(?)\]
-->

### <a name="verb_template"></a>5.2. Verb template <a href="#table_of_contents">^</a>

Verbal clitics, prefixes, and suffixes in Nga'ō always attach to the verb and each other in a fixed order in. None of these markers are mandatory, with the exception that transitive verbs require ergative suffixes. A template for verbs in Nga'ō is given below, with each position numbered in order. If a marker has allomorphs, the most common ones are given first.

### <a name="p_clitics"></a>5.3. Absolutive clitics (P clitics) <a href="#table_of_contents">^</a>

Verbs do not agree with their P arguments, but there is a set of anaphoric clitics that appear when their corresponding P arguments are not present in clauses as full NPs and are instead rendered as pronouns. Throughout this document, I will generally call these 'P clitics' for brevity and occasionally 'absolutive clitics' for clarity.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th></th>
    <th>Singular</th>
    <th>Plural</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1st person</td>
    <td><b>=ro</b></td>

    <td colspan=2><b>=??</b></td>
  </tr>
</table>

Table 5.2. _Absolutive clitics._

The surface forms of some of these clitics may be slightly different due to allophony described in [3.2.1](#allophony_consonants). Namely, the /ɾ/ of the first person singular is realized as \[l\] after a nasal or glottal consonant, and the sequence /sj/ that results from a word ending in /s/ taking a second person singular or first person plural clitic is pronounced as \[ʃ\].

<pre>
??? <b>nī ???</b>
???   <b>nī     ???</b>
sleep <b>DEF.PL child</b>
'The children are sleeping'

???<b>??</b>
???=<b>??</b>
sleep=<b>3PL.ABS</b>
'They're sleeping'

????????? <b>eng ???</b>

PST-PFV-drop-1SG.ERG <b>DEF.SG peach</b>
'I dropped the peach'

?????????<b>??</b>
 ??- ??-??? -??      <b>??</b>
PST-PFV-drop-1SG.ERG=<b>3SG.ABS</b>
'I dropped it'
</pre>

These clitics do not appear when P is topicalized, focused, or an interrogative word.

<pre>
?????<b>??</b> ?? ???
 ??-???    =<b>??</b>      ??  ???
PST-succeed=<b>1PL.ABS</b> LOC this
'We'll succeed in this'

<b>???</b> ????? ?? ???

'<b>We'll</b> succeed in this'

<b>???</b> ????? ?? ???
<b>???</b> ??-???     ??  ???
<b>who</b> PST-succeed LOC this
'Who will succeed in this?'
</pre>

Note that the second of the above examples is grammatical, but pragmatically it is only marginally acceptable to topicalize a pronoun in this way.

When a P argument is relativized, it is reduced to a pronoun in the relative clause, and so it is always realized with a P clitic.

<pre>

DEF.PL axe steel make-3PL.ERG=<b>3SG.ABS</b> here
'the steel axes that they make here'
</pre>

##### The reflexive clitic '=??'

The reflexive clitic **=??** is somewhat different from the others in that it does not distinguish person or number. It is used for reflexive constructions when the agent and patient of the verb are the same.

<pre>
?????????<b>??</b>
 ??- ??-??? -??     =<b>??</b>
PST-PFV-wash-1SG.ERG=<b>REFL</b>
'I washed myself'

'Did you burn yourself?'

Eng ??? ??? ??? ?????<b>??</b>
eng    ???   ???  ???   ???    -??=<b>??</b>
DEF.SG idiot that INFER deceive-3SG.ERG=<b>REFL</b>
'That idiot is fooling himself'

?????????<b>??</b> ?? eng ???

DESID-PST-say-1SG.ERG what but PST-PFV-stop-1SG.ERG=<b>REFL</b>
'I wanted to say something, but I stopped myself'
</pre>

When the sole argument of the verb is plural, the event may be interpreted as reflexive or reciprocal.

<pre>
?????<b>??</b>
???    -??     =<b>??</b>
destroy-2PL.ERG=<b>REFL</b>
'You're destroying each other' or 'You're destroying yourselves'

?????????<b>??</b>

'We painted each other' or 'We painted ourselves'

?????????<b>??</b>
 ??-???    -??  -??     =<b>??</b>
PST-comfort-CAUS-1PL.ERG=<b>REFL</b>
'They were comforting each other' or 'They were comforting themselves'
</pre>

This marker is not used when A is acting on an O that it possesses, especially when O is part of its body. When this is the case, O is stated as a separate NP.

<pre>
????????? <b>eng ?????</b>
 ??- ??-??? -??      <b>eng    ???-??</b>

</pre>

### <a name="p_clitic_analysis"></a>5.3.1. Analysis as clitics <a href="#table_of_contents">^</a>

The markers that I call 'P clitics' have much of the same behavior as suffixes, and it is tempting to simply include them in the list of other suffixed that were outlined in Table 5.1. Namely, they are bound morphemes that only attach to verbal hosts and undergo the same morphophonological processes as suffixes, rather than those that occur at word boundaries. Additionally, they are clearly bound in that they cannot occur by themselves; in answering a question such as _Who cares?_, the response can be a full pronoun such as \[?\] or \[?\] but cannot be a postverbal marker such as \[?\] or \[?\].

While all of the above is true, I posit that these are clitics rather than suffixes for a few main reasons. The first is that they are only present when a full NP that they would correspond to is not present in the clause. In that way, they exist in complimentary distribution with full NPs, and so their syntactic distribution defines them as clitics rather than prefixes.

Additionally, these markers are not only found attached to verbs themselves, but also incorporated nouns. Because these nouns are syntactically part of the verb phrase, it is the case that these clitics attach to the end of the verb phrase rather than the verb itself.

Lastly, unlike virtually all inflectional and derivational suffixes, these markers do not attract stress. This suggests that speakers consider them separate words syntactically even though they are phonologically dependent on their hosts.

### <a name="erg_agreement"></a>5.4. Ergative agreement <a href="#table_of_contents">^</a>

Transitive verbs agree with their agents in person and number with the following set of suffixes. Except for the second person forms, these exhibit a significant amount of allomorphy, which is explained later in this section.

|                | Singular | Plural |
| -------------- | -------- | ------ |
| **1st person** | -ra <br> _-re, -ro, -ta_ | -'ang <br> _-ssang_ |
| **2nd person** |     -ong |    -mi |
| **3rd person** | -s <br> _-su, ssu_ | -pe <br> _-ppe_ |

Unlike the P clitics, this is proper agreement, in that these suffixes are present even when A is overtly present in the clause as a full NP.

<pre>
???????<b>??</b> nī ??? eng ???
 ??- ??-???-<b>??</b>      nī     ???   eng    ???
PST-PFV-cut-<b>3PL.ERG</b> DEF.PL woman DEF.SG rope
'The women cut the rope'

?????<b>??</b>?? eng ???
 ??-???  -<b>??</b>     =??      eng    ???
PFV-judge-<b>3PL.ERG</b>=3PL.ABS DEF.SG chief
'The chief will judge them'
</pre>

These suffixes and possessive suffixes on nouns are formally identical. The allomorphy that they display was described in more detail in section [4.3](#possessive_suffixes).

<pre>
???<b>??</b> eng ???<b>??</b>
??? -<b>??</b>      eng    ???-<b>??</b>

'Are you looking for your mother'
</pre>

### <a name="verb_tense"></a>5.5. Tense <a href="#table_of_contents">^</a>

Verbs have two morphological tenses: past and nonpast. The nonpast tense is unmarked, while the past tense is marked by the prefix **to-**. This prefix surfaces as **to'-** before a long vowel and as **t-** before a word starting with **o-** followed by a geminate, such as **onni** '???'.

### <a name="verbal_aspect"></a>A.B. Aspect <a href="#table_of_contents">^</a>

Dynamic verbs may be marked for one or more of the following five aspects: perfective, progressive, iterative, habitual, and inceptive. Morphologically, these aspects are variously marked by null, prefixes, and reduplication. Their main functions are described below.

#### A.B.C. Perfective aspect

The perfective aspect is used to refer to events that are conceived of as a bounded whole without interior composition. It is unmarked on the verb morphologically.

    (A.#) ??????? ???
          ∅-  ???????             ???
          PFV-3SG.ABS:buy:1SG.ERG goat(?)
          'I bought a goat'

#### A.B.C. Progressive aspect

The progressive aspect is generally used with dynamic verbs to refer to events that are incomplete, in progress, or otherwise ongoing. It is marked by the prefix (?).

    (A.#) ??????? ??? ??????? ??? ?????
          ???????             ???  ??-  ?????         ??? ?????
          3SG.ABS:see:1SG.ERG COMP PROG-3PL.ABS:laugh PL  child:3PL.POSS
          'I see some of their children laughing'

    (A.#) ????????? ??? ??? ???
          ??-  ???????             ???     ???    ???
          PROG-3SG.ABS:don:3SG.ERG robe(?) DEF.SG woman
          'The woman is putting on a robe(?)'

    (A.#) ??????? ??? ???
          ??-  ?????                ???       ???
          PROG-3SG.ABS:cook.INTR(?) DEF.SG(?) rice(?)
          'The rice is cooking'

For verbs that refer to mental states, such as (?) 'to know' or (?) 'to like', the progressive is used to refer to being in that mental state. Using one of these verbs in the perfective aspect refers to entry into its state.

    (A.#) ??? ????????? ??? ???????¿
          ??? ??-  ???????               ???    ???????
          Q   PROG-3SG.ABS:know:2PL.POSS DEF.SG method(?):make:3SG.POSS
          'Do you know how to make it?'

    (A.#) ????????? ??? ??? ??? ???
          ??-  ???????              ???    ???  ???     ???
          PROG-3PL.ABS:like:3SG.ERG DEF.PL bird from(?) here(?)
          'She likes the birds in this area'

    (A.#) ??????? ??? ????? ???
          ∅-  ???????                 ???  ?????            ???
          PFV-3SG.ABS:know:1PL.EX.ERG COMP PFV:3PL.ABS:come yesterday
          'We learned that they came yesterday'

#### A.B.C. Iterative aspect

The iterative aspect is used to denote repetitions of an event, which may be of short duration or persist for some time. It might variously be translated into English using phrases such as "repeatedly", "over and over", or "for a while", depending on the semantics of the verb. It is marked by full reduplication of the verb stem.

    (A.#) ????????, ??? ??? ????? ???
          ??     -???~???  ??? ??? ?????            ???
          1SG.ABS-ITV~call but NEG 3SG.ABS:COP.INAN response
          'I called and called, but there was no response'
    
    (A.#) ??????? ?????
          ??     -???~???   ???
          3SG.ABS-ITV~blink fast
          'She blinked rapidly'

This reduplication marks the iterative aspect only for telic verbs. Its other function, which is available to both telic and atelic verbs, is to intensify the verb. Whether the verb is to be read as happening multiple times or intensely is dependent on its telicity as well as context.

    (A.#) ??? ???????????? ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ????? ???
          ???       ????        -???~?????         ???  ???     ???    ???  ???    ???    ?????  ???
          yesterday PROG:3PL.ABS-ITV~throw:3SG.ERG rock into(?) DEF.SG lake LOC(?) DEF.SG NMZ:go this
          'Yesterday, she was throwing rocks into the lake for a while like this', or 'Yesterday, she was hurling rocks into the lake like this'
    
    (A.#) ????????
          ??     -???~???
          3PL.ABS-ITV~be.afraid
          'They are very afraid', not *'They are afraid repeatedly'

#### A.B.C. Habitual aspect

The habitual aspect is used to refer to events that happen habitually or customarily. _\[unclear if this or the progressive aspect is more appropriate for 'living'\]_ (?). It is marked by partial reduplication of the verb stem, with the last VC sequence being reduplicated to its right. \[*-leka > *-lekeka, *-ome- > *-omome-, etc. (?)\]

    (A.#) ??????? ??? ????? ??? ??? ???
          ?????          ~??? ???    ?????           ???    ???    ???
          3SG.ABS:wake.up~HAB DEF.SG mother:1SG.POSS LOC(?) DEF.SG sunrise(?)
          'My mother wakes up at sunrise'

    (A.#) ???, ????????? ??? ?????
          ???          ?????                   ~???-??      ???    ?????
          last.year(?) 3SG.ABS:carry.on.back(?)~HAB-2SG.ERG DEF.SG son:2SG.POSS
          'Last year, you would carry your son on your back'

When the subject or agent of the verb is topicalized, this aspect can be interpreted as habitual or gnomic, expressing general truths. A gnomic reading is blocked by the presence of a deictic temporal adverbial and is otherwise conditioned by context.

    (A.#) ??? ??? ???????
          ???    ???   ?????       ~???
          DEF.PL tiger 3PL.ABS:roar~HAB
          'The tigers roar', or 'Tigers roar'

    (A.#) ??? ??? ??? ???????
          ???           ???    ???   ?????       ~???
          last.month(?) DEF.PL tiger 3PL.ABS:roar~HAB
          'Last month, the tigers would roar', not *'Last month, tigers roar (as a general truth)'

#### A.B.C. Inceptive aspect

The inceptive aspect is used to refer to events that are beginning or starting. It is marked by the prefix (?). For dynamic verbs, it combines freely with the habitual and iterative aspects, but it can only combine with the progressive aspect periphrastically.

    (A.#) ??????? ??? ???
          ??- ?????       ???    ???
          INC-3SG.ABS:run DEF.SG girl
          'The girl started to run'

    (A.#) ????????? ??? ??? ???
          ??- ???????          ??? ???    ???
          INC-3SG.ABS:wake:HAB LOC DEF.SG dawn
          'He started waking up at dawn'

    (A.#) ??? ??????? ??? ??? ??-???????
          ???   ???????                     ???    ???   ??- ???????
          after PFV:3SG.ABS:suck(?):1SG.ERG DEF.SG smoke INC-1SG.ABS:ITV:cough
          'After I inhaled the smoke, I started to cough repeatedly'

    (A.#) ????????? ??? ??? ??? ???
          ?????????                  ???    ??? ???    ???
          PROG:3SG.ABS:begin:3SG.ERG DEF.SG run DEF.SG girl
          'The girl is starting to run'

For stative verbs, it indicates entry into that state and has a meaning similar to the English "to become". More precisely, it might be said that this prefix marks both the inceptive and inchoative aspects, but I will continue to refer to its aspectual range as just 'inceptive' for simplicity. Unlike for dynamic verbs, it does not combine with other aspects.

    (A.#) ???????
          ??- ?????
          INC-3PL.ABS:be.afraid
          'They became afraid'

    (A.#) ??? ??????? ??? ??? ???
          ??? ??- ?????           ???    ???    ???
          FUT INC-3SG.ABS:be.easy LOC(?) DEF.SG summer
          'It will be easier in the summer'

    (A.#) ??? ??? ???????
          ???    ???     ??- ?????
          DEF.SG outside INC-3SG.ABS:be.dark
          'It got dark outside'

### <a name="verbal_negation"></a>A.B. Negation <a href="#table_of_contents">^</a>

Verbal negation is done with the particle (?), which immediately precedes the verb and any aspect or mood particles that may be accompanying it.

    (A.#) ??? ??? ??????? ??? ????
          ???            ??? ???????                    ???    ???
          fortunately(?) NEG PFV:3PL.ABS:notice:3SG.ERG DEF.SG shark
          'Fortunately, the shark didn't notice them'

    (A.#) ??? ????? ??? ??? ???
          ??? ?????                   ???    ???  ???
          NEG PFV:3SG.ABS:precipitate DEF.SG rain yesterday
          'It didn't rain yesterday'

In clauses containing negative indefinite pronouns, the predicate is also negated.

    (A.#) ??? ????? ??? ???
          ??? ?????          ???  ???
          NEG PFV:3SG.ABS:go even where
          'It didn't go anywhere'

    (A.#) ??? ??? ??? ??????? ??? ?????
          ???  ??? ??? ???????                ???  ?????
          even who NEG PFV:3SG(?).ABS:wait:AP with PL:that
          'No one waited for them'

Additionally, this particle is used to negate nominal predicates as well as adjectives.

    (A.#) ??? ??? ???
          ??? ??? ???
          yon NEG tiger
          'That over there isn't a tiger'

    (A.#) ??? ????? ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ???
          ??? ?????            ???    ???     ??? ???    ???    ???
          INC PFV:3SG.ABS:walk DEF.SG bear(?) NEG afraid LOC(?) 1PL.EX
          'The unafraid bear started to walk towards us'

#### A.B.C. Negative imperatives

Negative imperatives, sometimes called 'prohibitives', are made differently than both negative indicative statements and affirmative imperatives. The verb is in the subjunctive mood, and the negative particle is different than in indicative statements.

    (A.#) ??? ???????!
          ??? ???- ?????
          NEG SUBJ-2SG.ABS:go
          'Don't go!'

### <a name="predicative_adjectives"></a>A.B. Predicative adjectives <a href="#table_of_contents">^</a>

When used predicatively, adjectives are syntactically and morphologically identical to stative verbs.

    (A.#) ??? ??????? ??? ??? ??? ?????????
          ??? ???????             ???    ???   ??? ?????????
          EPI 3SG.ABS:ITV:be.wide DEF.SG house REL PROG:3SG.ABS:build:2PL.ERG
          'It looks like the house that you're building will be very spacious'

    (A.#) ??? ???????!
          ??? ???????
          NEG SBJV:2SG:be.stubborn
          'Don't be stubborn!'

### <a name="attributive_adjectives"></a>A.B. Attributive adjectives <a href="#table_of_contents">^</a>

When acting attributively, adjectives lose most verb morphology, including agreement morphology and aspect marking, and they must immediately follow the noun that they modify. However, they can be negated and intensified using the same morphology as verbs.

    (A.#) ??? ??? ???
          ??? ???   ???
          PL  woman tall
          'tall women'

    (A.#) ??? ??? ???
          ???   ??? ???
          water NEG clean
          'unclean water'

    (A.#) ??? ?????
          ??? ???~???
          day ITV~hot
          'very hot day'

### <a name="adjectival_inflection"></a>A.B. Adjectival inflection <a href="#table_of_contents">^</a>

#### A.B.C. Adjectives without head nouns

When a noun is contextually retrievable or considered unimportant, it can be omitted. When an omitted noun is modified by an adjective, an appropriate classifier must take its place to be modified. When this happens, the classifier stands as the head of the noun phrase and can take possessive suffixes like a noun.

    (A.#) ????????? ????? ??? ???
          ?????????                ?????            ???
          IMP:3SG.ABS:give:2SG.ERG CLF.INAN:1SG.ERG red
          'Give me a red one'

    (A.#) ??? ??? ??? ????? ??? ?????

          DEF.PL CLF.INAN small 3PL.ABS:be.delicious from PL:that
          'The small ones taste better than those'

### <a name="personal_pronouns"></a>A.B. Personal pronouns <a href="#table_of_contents">^</a>

The personal pronouns of Ekhwachi are summarized below:

  </tr>
</table>

Figure A. _Personal pronouns._

The third person pronouns are morphologically and syntactically identical to demonstrative pronouns, which are described in detail in the following section.

Because the main arguments of verb phrases are indexed on the verb, these pronouns are rarely seen outside of prepositional phrases.

<!--

_\[All plural pronouns, except possibly for one of 1PL, are derived from their singular counterparts with a prefix that diachronically comes from the associative plural particle. 1PL.IN was derived before this by juxtaposing 1 and 2 and doesn't technically require the particle, but it might just be used by analogy\]_ (?)

_\[When verbs begin to agree with their objects, all third person forms cliticize and become affixes on the verbs. Because the medial demonstratives are so much more common than the others, those agreement markers eventually supercede the others\]_ (?)

There are no number distinctions, and noun coordination is done by simple juxtaposition, so communicating the first person plural is done with "me you" or "me \[demonstrative\]" while the second person plural is done with "you \[demonstrative\]".

-->

### <a name="demonstrative_pronouns"></a>A.B. Demonstrative pronouns <a href="#table_of_contents">^</a>

The demonstrative pronouns are the same as the third person pronouns from the previous section, and they can also be used as determiners. They are repeated below for convenience.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th></th>
    <th>Singular</th>
    <th>Plural</th>

Figure A. _Demonstratives._

These demonstratives have a three-way distance contrast of proximal/medial/distal, which basically correspond to the English demonstratives 'this', 'that', and dated/dialectal 'yon'. Because 'yon' is not recognizable to most English speakers, (?)/(?) will be translated as 'that/those over there', but for brevity they will still be glossed as 'yon'.

    (A.#) ??? ??? ??? ?????
          ???    ???      ??? ?????
          DEF.PL mushroom red PL:this
          'these red mushrooms'

    (A.#) ????????? ???
          ?????????                ???
          IMP:3SG.ABS:take:2SG.ERG this
          'Take this'

    (A.#) ??? ??? ??? ???????
          ???    ???   ???  ???????
          DEF.SG tiger that 3SG.ABS:ITV:be.big
          'That tiger is very big'

    (A.#) ????? ?????
          ????? ?????
          3PL.ABS:be.pretty PL:that
          'Those/they are pretty'

    (A.#) ??? ????? ??? ??? ??? ??? ?????¿
          ??? ???????             ???    ???  ???
          Q   3SG.ABS:see:2PL.ERG DEF.SG hill yon
          'Do you see that hill over there?'

    (A.#) ???
          ???
          PL:yon
          'those over there'

The contrast between proximal/medial/distal is based on physical distance away from the speaker and doesn't account for the listener's position. In practice, the medial demonstratives are used most commonly for referents near the listener because the listener is rarely close or far enough away that the other forms would be appropriate.

### <a name="reflexive_pronouns"></a>A.B. Reflexive pronouns <a href="#table_of_contents">^</a>

For reflexive constructions, the verb becomes intransitive and is immediately followed by the noun (?). This is an instance of Type I noun incorporation, so no words can come between the verb and (?).

    (A.#) ????? ???
          ∅-??-???         ???
          PFV-1SG.ABS-wash REFL
          'I washed myself'

    (A.#) ??? ??? ????? ????? ??? ???
          ???    ???    ?????   ?????                ???  ???
          DEF.PL person this:PL PROG:3PL.ABS:protect REFL just(?)
          'These people are just protecting themselves'

The reflexive is not used when originally, the A is acting on a P that it possesses, especially when P is part of its body.

    (A.#) ????? ???
          ?????            ???
          PFV:1SG.ABS:bite tongue
          'I bit myself in the tongue', or 'I bit my tongue'

    (A.#) * ??????? ??? ??? ?????
            ???????                  ???  ???    ?????
            PFV:3SG.ABS:bite:1SG.ERG REFL DEF.SG tongue:1SG.POSS
            Intended: 'I bit myself in the tongue', or 'I bit my tongue'

    (A.#) ????? ???
          ?????           ???
          PFV:3SG.ABS:cut palm(?)
          'He cut himself in the palm', or 'He cut his (own) palm'

    (A.#) * ??????? ??? ??? ?????
            ???????                 ???  ???    ?????
            PFV:3SG.ABS:cut:1SG.ERG REFL DEF.SG palm(?):1SG.POSS
            Intended: 'He cut himself in the palm', or 'He cut his (own) palm'

Additionally, (?) can be used as an intensifier, in which case it can be used adnominally or adverbally.

    (A.#) ??? ????? ??? ??? ????????? ?????
          ???    ?????           ???  ??? ?????????                    ?????

Indefinite pronouns in Ekhwachi are identical to or otherwise derived from the interrogative pronouns of the previous section. There are four different series of indefinite pronouns in Ekhwachi, which are listed alongside their English translations in the table below. I will be following the framework and terminology used in Haspelmath (1997), which describes indefinite pronouns as performing nine distinct but interrelated functions.

Figure A. _Indefinite pronouns._

#### A.B.C. The A-series

This corresponds only to Haspelmath's 'specific known' category. These pronouns refer to indefinites that are both specific and known to the speaker. This series is formed by taking an interrogative pronoun and following it with an appropriate classifier.

    (A.#) ??????? ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ???
          ???????               ???  ???      ???      ???    ???    ???  ???
          PFV:3SG.ABS:PASS:find what CLF.NHAN fearsome LOC(?) DEF.SG cave that
          'Something fearsome was found in that cave'

    (A.#) ??????? ??? ??????? ??? ??? ??? ??? ?????
          ???????                      ???  ???????          ??? ???     ???  ???    ?????
          PFV:3SG.ABS:watch(?):1SG.ERG COMP PROG:3SG.ABS:run who CLF.HUM from DEF.SG house:3SG.POSS
          'I watched someone running out of his house'

#### A.B.C. The B-series

The B-series corresponds to four of Haspelmath's categories: 'specific unknown', 'irrealis non-specific', 'polar question', and 'conditional protasis'. The pronouns of this series are identical in form to the interrogative pronouns. Like its name suggests, the 'specific unknown' category refers to indefinites that are specific but unknown to the speaker.

    (A.#) ??? ????? ??? ????? ???
          ???    ?????          ???  ?????            ???
          DEF.SG sound:3SG.POSS COMP PFV:3SG.ABS:fall what
          'sound of something falling'

    (A.#) ??? ????????? ???
          ??? ?????????                        ???
          EPI PROG:3SG.ABS:look.for(?):3SG.ERG who
          'She must be looking for someone'

The 'irrealis non-specific' category refers to indefinites that are both non-specific and unknown to the speaker.

    (A.#) ??? ??? ????????? ???
          ??? ??? ?????????                   ???
          Q   DEO SBJV(?):3SG.ABS:eat:1SG.ERG what
          'I wonder if I should eat something'

    (A.#) ????? ????????? ???
          ?????           ?????????                       ???
          1SG.ABS:want(?) SBJV(?):3SG.ABS:meet(?):1SG.ERG when
          'I want to see her again sometime'

The 'polar question' category refers to indefinites that are used in affirmative polar questions.

    (A.#) ??? ?????¿ ??? ??????? ???¿
          ??? ?????           ??? ???????                     ???
          Q   2SG.ABS:be.good Q   PFV:2SG.ABS:hurt:3SG.ERG(?) who
          'Your face! Are you okay? Did someone hurt you?'

    (A.#) ??? ??????? ??? ??? ??? ???¿
          ??? ???????                      ???    ???         ??? ???
          Q   PFV:3SG.ABS:enter:3SG.ERG(?) DEF.SG building(?) who suspicious
          'Did anyone suspicious enter the building?'

The 'conditional protasis' category refers to indefinites that are used within the dependent clause of a conditional statement.

    (A.#) ??? ??????? ??? ???, ?????????
          ??? ???????                 ???  ???       ?????????
          if  ???(?):3SG.ABS:COP.NHAN what dangerous IMP(?):1PL.EX.ABS:call:2PL.ERG
          'If there's anything dangerous, call out for us'

    (A.#) ??? ??? ??????? ??? ??? ??? ???, ??? ???????
          ???  ??? ???????                        ???  ???    ???     ??? ??? ???????
          even if  PFV:3SG.ABS:cut.off(?):3SG.ERG head DEF.SG monster who EPI SBJV(?):3SG.ABS:survive
          'Even if someone cut off the monster's head, it should survive'

#### A.B.C. The C-series

The C-series corresponds to Haspelmath's 'indirect negation' and 'direction negation' categories, and its pronouns are formed by preceding interrogative pronouns with the focus particle (?). In both instances, the indefinite pronoun is within the scope of negation.

    (A.#) ??? ??? ??? ??????? ??? ???
          ??? ???  ??? ???????                    ???    ???
          FOC what NEG PFV:3SG.ABS:buy:1PL.EX.ERG LOC(?) there
          'We didn't buy anything there'

    (A.#) ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ???????
          ???    ??? ??? ???  ??? ???????
          DEF.SG boy FOC what NEG 3SG.ABS:say:3SG.ERG
          'The boy didn't say anything'

Like other focused arguments, a C-series pronoun always precedes the verb, and if it is originally an A, the verb is in the antipassive voice to promote it to the role of S.

    (A.#) ??? ??? ????????? ??? ??? ??? ????????? ??? ??? ??? ???¿
          ??? ??? ?????????                    ???  ??? ??? ?????????                ???  ???    ???      ???
          Q   NEG ???(?):3SG.ABS:think:2SG.ERG COMP FOC who ABIL:3SG(?).ABS:climb:AP with DEF.SG mountain yon
          'You don't think that anyone can climb that mountain?'

    (A.#) ??? ????? ??? ??? ??? ??? ????????? ??? ????
          ???    ?????             ???    ??? ??? ??? ?????????            ??? ????
          LOC(?) where:3SG.POSS(?) forest FOC who NEG PROG:3SG.ABS:know:AP Q   3PL.ABS:COP.HUM
          'No one knows where they are in the forest'

#### A.B.C. The D-series

The D-series corresponds to Haspelmath's 'standard of comparison' and 'free choice' categories, and its pronouns are formed by fully reduplicating interrogative pronouns. Unlike the other series (?), these pronouns are grammatically plural.

    (A.#) ??? ????? ??? ????? ??? ??????
          ???    ?????            ???  ?????          ???  ???~???
          DEF.SG town:1PL.EX.POSS this 3SG.ABS:be.old from any~where
          'This town of ours is older than anywhere (else)'

    (A.#) ????????? ??? ????? ?????
          ?????????                  ???    ?????           ???~???
          ABIL:3SG.ABS:learn:3PL.ERG DEF.SG method(?):weave any~who
          'Anyone can learn how to weave'

    (A.#) ??? ????? ??? ??????? ??? ????? ??? ?????????
          ???    ?????             ???   ???????          ???  ???~??? ??? ?????????
          DEF.SG daughter:1SG.POSS young 3SG.ABS:talk:HAB with any~who REL SBJV:3PL.ABS:listen:AP
          'My young daughter talks to whoever will listen (to her)'

<!--
\['someone', 'something', etc. are based on interrogative words. These are likely formed by reduplication, though the kind of reduplication is not yet known, and the end result might be rendered as two separate words if it's full reduplication\]

1: specific, known to the speaker
   '[Somebody] called when you were away; guess who!'
   '[WHO-CLF] called when you were away; guess who!'
   ? 'PFV:P(?)3SG:call someone when ???:2SG.ABS:go; IMP:2SG.ABS:guess who CLF.HUM'

6: indirect negation
   'I don't think that [anybody] knows the answer', 'I doubt that he stole [anything]', 'They didn't dare ask him [anything] more'

Basically anyone can be associated with this referential individual, including family, friends, and people who are of only casual or transient acquaintance. This is most commonly used with proper names and kinship terms, and like the indefinite plural particle, it is restricted to animate nouns.

The counting system of Ekhwachi is decimal.

#### A.B.C. Cardinal numbers

Below are the patterns for the cardinal numbers from 1 to 20.

|    |     |    |     |
| -- | --- | -- | --- |
| 1  | ??? | 11 | ??? |
| 2  | ??? | 12 | ??? |
| 3  | ??? | 13 | ??? |
| 4  | ??? | 14 | ??? |
| 5  | ??? | 15 | ??? |
| 6  | ??? | 16 | ??? |
| 7  | ??? | 17 | ??? |
| 8  | ??? | 18 | ??? |
| 9  | ??? | 19 | ??? |
| 10 | ??? | 20 | ??? |

#### A.B.C. Ordinal numbers

\[ordinal numbers follow some regular pattern except for 'first', which is suppletive; likely derives from something meaning 'before'; other ordinals are formed with a preceding word or prefix\]

#### A.B.C. Fractions

Fractional numerals are formed with the affix _???_ (?), which is attached to the last numeral in the numeral phrase.

    (A.#) ????? ??? ???
          ?????(?)   ??? ???
          three.FRAC two CLF.INAN
          'two thirds', '2/3'

    (A.#) ??? ??? ????? ??? ???
          ??? ??? ?????    ???   ???
          ten and six.FRAC seven CLF.INAN
          'seven sixteenths', '7/16'

    (A.#) ??? ??? ??? ????? ??? ??? ??? ??? ???
          ???   ??? ??? ?????(?) ???   ??? ??? ???   ???
          eight ten and six.FRAC three ten and three CLF.INAN
          'thirty three eighty-sixths', '33/86'

When the fractional numeral is being used in conjunction with a noun, it is possessed by the noun and acts as the head of the noun phrase.

    (A.#) ????? ??????? ??? ??? ??? ???
          ??-     ???    ?????(?) -??       ???   ???      ???    ???
          3PL.ABS-be.red four.FRAC-3PL.POSS three CLF.INAN DEF.PL flower
          'Three fourths of the flowers are red'

    (A.#) ????? ??????? ??? ??? ??? ???
          ??-     ???    ?????(?) -??       ???   ???      ???    ???
          3PL.ABS-be.red four.FRAC-3SG.POSS three CLF.INAN DEF.SG flower
          'Three fourths of the flower are red'

#### A.B.C. Distributive numerals

Distributive numerals are formed using the prefix _??-_ (?).

### <a name="classifiers"></a>A.B. Classifiers <a href="#table_of_contents">^</a>

For nearly all nouns in Ekhwachi, they cannot be directly quantified with numerals; they must be accompanied by a classifier when they co-occur. While the prototypical use of these classifiers is to quantify nouns in this way, they occur without numerals in some constructions.

#### A.B.C. List of classifiers

Ekhwachi has (?) (currently 7) classifiers, which are summarized below.

| Classifier | Gloss     | Principal uses |
| ---------- | :-------- | :------------- |
| ???        | CLF.HUM   | Humans |
| ???        | CLF.NHUM  | Living nonhuman animates |
| ???        | CLF.plant | Plants and fungi |
| ???        | CLF.place | Physical locations, including natural locations such as forests as well as artificial ones such as houses or towns |
| ???        | CLF.long  | Essentially one-dimensional objects, which may be rigid, such as sticks or bones, or flexible, such as hair or rope |
| ???        | CLF.flat  | Essentially two-dimensional objects such as plates and most articles of clothing |
| ???        | CLF.INAN  | General-purpose classifier for inanimates not covered by other classifiers, including essentially three-dimensional objects, dead nonhuman(?) animates, and abstracts |

Figure A. _Classifiers._

#### A.B.C. Classifier usage

All classifiers can be directly quantified by numerals, and a numeral-classifier phrase can itself quantify a noun that precedes it.

    (A.#) ??? ???
          ??? ???
          two CLF.HUM
          'two people'

    (A.#) ??? ??? ???
          ???   ???   ???
          house three CLF.INAN
          'three houses'

When a noun is quantified by a numeral-classifier phrase, it may not be preceded by the indefinite plural particle (?), even when the numeral is greater than 1.

    (A.#) ??? ???
          ??? ???
          PL  child
          'children'

    (A.#) * ??? ??? ??? ???
          ??? ???   ???   ???
          PL  child three CLF.HUM
          Intended: 'three children'

When the numeral is greater than 1, the noun is still semantically and grammatically plural, as can be seen in agreement patterns of both verbs and demonstratives.

    (A.#) ????????? ??? ??? ??? ??? ?????
          ??? -???-    ?????             ???    ???        ??? ???      ???-???
          PROG-3PL.ABS-follow:1PL.EX.ERG DEF.PL (bird sp.) two CLF.NHAN PL- that
          'We're following those two birds(?)'

All nouns can take at least one classifier, though some take multiple. All nonhuman animates usually take the classifier (?), but they take (?) if they are not alive at the point of reference.

    (A.#) ??????? ??? ??? ??? ??? ???
          ???????                 ???  ???   ???      ???    ???
          PFV:3PL.ABS:eat:3SG.ERG fish three CLF.INAN DEF.SG bird
          'The bird ate three fish (which were already dead)'

    (A.#) ??????? ??? ??? ??? ???
          ???????                 ???  ???   ???      ???    ???
          PFV:3PL.ABS:eat:3SG.ERG fish three CLF.NHAN DEF.SG bird
          'The bird ate three fish (alive)'

Additionally, nonhuman animates that are essentially one- or two-dimensional can take the shape-based classifiers (?) and (?), respectively, with little change in meaning, aside from the fact that animals quantified with them may be alive or dead.

Anything that is especially close to being one- or two-dimensional can always take the relevant classifier, but things that are less prototypical can only take the classifier when they are closer to being the shape than is expected. For example, (?) can always be used to quantify snakes, but it would be generally unacceptable to use for dogs. However, (?) might be used to refer to a dachshund to draw attention to how much longer it is than most other dogs. It also might be used to refer to a particularly lanky person to draw attention to their proportions. This more or less metaphorical usage is quite marked and is restricted to less formal registers.

#### A.B.C. Classifiers without numerals

Classifiers have one main use outside of pairing with numerals to quantify nouns. An interrogative word followed by a classifier is used to form an indefinite pronoun, which refers to something specific and known to the speaker.

    (A.#) ??????? ??? ??? ?????? ??? ??? ??? ???
          ???????                  ???  ???      ??????             ???    ???    ???   ???
          PFV:3SG.ABS:find:1SG.ERG what CLF.INAN ITV:interesting(?) LOC(?) DEF.SG river yesterday
          'I found something very interesting in the river yesterday'

#### A.B.C. Quantifying time

The only nouns that do not need classifiers to be quantified with numerals are those for units of time, such as 'hour', 'day', 'year', etc. While these words are like classifiers in that they can be directly quantified by numerals, which precede them, they cannot be used to quantify nouns.

    (A.#) ??? ???
          ???  ???
          four day
          'four days'
    
    (A.#) * ????? ??? ???

          Intended: 'five hour's worth of hunting'
          Actual: 'hunting for five hours'

Figure A. _The order of elements in a noun phrase. Elements marked with an asterisk are mutually exclusive and do not occur together in the same noun phrase._

    (A.#) ??? ????? ??? ??? ??? ??? ????? ??? ??? ?????
          ???    ?????           ???   ???    ???   ???      ?????   ???  ??? ?????

          'these three too-heavy branches of a tree that fell'
          
In the above example, it can only be the branches that fell and not the tree because of the number agreement on the verb. However, when both a genitive and a relative clause are present, it may be ambiguous as to whether it is modifying the genitive or the head of the noun phrase if verb agreement doesn't clarify.

    (A.#) ??? ????? ??? ??? ??? ?????
          ???    ?????         ???    ???   ??? ?????
          DEF.SG face:3SG.POSS DEF.SG woman REL 3SG.ABS:be.beautiful
          'the face of the woman who is beautiful', or 'the woman's face that is beautiful'

#### A.B.C. Relationships between elements

The indefinite and associative plural particles (?) and (?) cannot occur in the presence of a classifier. Additionally, a genitive, which is itself a full noun phrase, may only be expressed if the head noun has a possessive suffix.

The order of words in a verb phrase that has all possible modifiers is given below.

(?)

### <a name="nominal_locative_predication"></a>A.B. Nominal and locative predication <a href="#table_of_contents">^</a>

Nominal predicates in Ekhwachi don't make use of any overt verb-like element, but locative predication is done with one of a small set of locative copular verbs, which differ based on the animacy of the subject. The constructions used for locative predication are also used for predicative possession.

#### A.B.C. Nominal predication

To express that two things are the same, they are usually simply juxtaposed without an overt copula. Unlike verbal predicates, their topics always precede them, and they don't take agreement morphology, so they require that a noun phrase precede them.

    (A.#) ??? ????? ???
          ??? ?????              ???
          DEF.SG father:1SG.POSS shaman
          'My father was/is/will be a shaman'

    (A.#) ??? ??? ??? ??? ???
          ???    ???   ??? ???    ???
          DEF.PL tiger PL  animal dangerous
          'Tigers were/are/will be dangerous animals'

    (A.#) ??? ?????
          ???  ?????
          that responsibility:1PL.EX.POSS
          'It/that is our responsibility'

In line with other predicates, they will generally be translated as being in the present tense throughout this document except in the examples immediately above. Even without an overt copula, the nominal predicate takes non-inflectional verb morphology, including the negative particle (?), and the mood particles (?) and (?). They can also be relativized in the same way.

    (A.#) ??? ??? ??? ???
          ??? ??? ??? ???
          2SG NEG DEO thief
          'You shouldn't be a thief'

    (A.#) ??? ??? ???
          ???  ??? ???
          that NEG joke
          'You're kidding me', 'You can't be serious', etc. (lit. 'That's not a joke')

    (A.#) ??? ????? ??? ?????
          ???    ?????           ??? ?????
          DEF.SG mother:3SG.POSS REL friend:1SG.POSS
          'her mother, who is my friend'

#### Locative predication

The locative copulas (?), (?), and (?) are used to express locative as well as existential predication. The first is used for humans, the second for non-human animates, and the third for inanimates.

    (A.#) ???, ????? ??? ??? ???
          ???  ?????           ???    ??? ???
          here 3PL.ABS:COP.HUM person two CLF.HUM
          'Here, there are two people'

    (A.#) ??? ????? ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ????? ???
          ??? ?????            ???    ???     ???  ???    ???    ?????         ???
          EPI 3SG.ABS:COP.NHAN DEF.SG bear(?) that LOC(?) DEF.SG cave:3SG.POSS now
          'That bear should be in its cave now'

    (A.#) ????? ??? ??? ??? ???
          ?????            ???    ???    ???    ???
          3SG.ABS:COP.INAN basket LOC(?) DEF.SG floor
          'There is a basket on the floor'

These copulae are also used for predicative possession. The syntactic subject is the noun with a possessive suffix, and the semantic possessor is the object of the locative preposition (?). Pronominal possessors are expressed only by their corresponding suffix.

    (A.#) ????? ????? ??? ???
          ?????           ?????          ???  ???
          3PL.ABS:COP.HUM child:1SG.POSS five CLF.HUM
          'I have five children'

    (A.#) ??? ??? ??? ????? ????? ??? ???
          ???    ???  ???  ?????            ?????        ???   ???
          DEF.SG fish this 3PL.ABS:COP.INAN eye:3SG.POSS three CLF.INAN
          'This fish, it has three eyes'

    (A.#) ????? ??? ??? ???
          ?????            ??? ???   ???
          3PL.ABS:COP.INAN eye three CLF.INAN
          'There are three eyes'


## <a name="coordination"></a>A. Coordination <a href="#table_of_contents">^</a>

### <a name="coordination_content"></a>A.B. Content of this section (?) <a href="#table_of_contents">^</a>

The conjunction (?) 'and' coordinates two or more noun phrases, verb phrases, or clauses.

### <a name="coreferential_deletion"></a>A.B. Coreferential deletion (?) <a href="#table_of_contents">^</a>

When the verbs in two clauses share at least one argument, that argument can usually be deleted. A verb expects certain kinds of arguments, either explicitly due to agreement or implicitly through its semantics, and if only one of the available arguments can meet those expectations, it can be deleted in the second clause.

Otherwise, when verb agreement and semantics don't make clear how to interpret the second clause when an argument is deleted, there are two patterns of deletion. In the first pattern, which is used when no argument is topicalized, coordination is syntactically ergative; it can be deleted if it is a P in the second clause. In the second pattern, which is used when an argument is topicalized, coordination is syntactically accusative; it can be deleted if it is an S or A in the second clause.

In practice, this is a strong tendency rather than an absolute rule. More accurately, the patterns describe the default interpretation without further context, but the interpretation can change if more information is made available.

#### <a name="coreferential_deletion_unique"></a>A.B.C. Deleting a grammatically or semantically unique argument <a href="#table_of_contents">^</a>

As in many head-marking languages, an argument can be deleted regardless of its syntactic role when agreement patterns keep the information unambiguous.

    ??????? ??? ???????
    ???????                 ??? ???????
    PFV:3PL.ABS:see:1SG.ERG and INC:PFV:1SG.ABS:run
    'I saw them and I started to run'

The same applies for verb semantics and context. In the example below, the two available arguments are the boulder and the tiger, and while syntactically it would be expected that the boulder would be coordinated, instead it is the tiger that is. Because the tiger is animate and the boulder is not, and because the tiger presumably suffered a possibly mortal injury from the boulder having fallen on it, it is the only argument that can satisfy (?), 'to die'.

    ????? ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ?????
    ?????            ???    ???     ??? ???   ??? ?????
    PFV:3SG.ABS:fall DEF.SG boulder LOC tiger and PFV:3SG.ABS:die
    'The boulder fell on a tiger and it (the tiger) died'

#### <a name="coreferential_deletion_unique"></a>A.B.C. Deleting a non-unique argument <a href="#table_of_contents">^</a>

There are times when no combination of agreement marking, context, or verbal semantics serves to unambiguously indicate what argument may carry over between two clauses. When this ambiguity occurs, it is usually topicalization that determines which can be deleted in the second clause. In sentences without a topicalized argument, when two coordinated clauses share a common NP, it can only be deleted in the second clause when it is a P in both clauses. In other words, clausal coordination in these constructions is syntactically ergative.

    (A.#) ????????? ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ???????
          ?????????                 ???    ??? ???    ???   ??? ???????
          PROG:3SG.ABS:hold:3SG.ERG DEF.SG man DEF.SG woman and PROG:3SG.ABS:smile
          'The woman is hugging the man and (he is) smiling'

    (A.#) ??????? ??? ??? ??? ??? ?????
          ???????                    ???  ???    ???        ??? ?????
          PFV:3SG.ABS:strike:3SG.ERG wall DEF.SG boulder(?) and PFV:3SG.ABS:shatter.INTR(?)
          'The boulder hit a wall and (the wall) shattered'

    (A.#) ????? ??? ??? ??? ??????? ??? ???
          ?????             ???    ???       ??? ???????                  ???    ???

          'The hunter stood up and the bear killed him'

However, when an S or A is topicalized, it is only deleted in the second clause when it is an S or A there as well.

    (A.#) ??? ??? ????????? ??? ??? ??? ???????
          ???    ???   ?????????                 ???    ??? ??? ???????
          DEF.SG woman PROG:3SG.ABS:hold:3SG.ERG DEF.SG man and PROG:3SG.ABS:smile
          'The woman is hugging the man and (she is) smiling'

    (A.#) ??? ??? ??????? ??? ??? ?????
          ???    ???        ???????                    ???  ??? ?????
          DEF.SG boulder(?) PFV:3SG.ABS:strike:3SG.ERG wall and PFV:3SG.ABS:shatter.INTR(?)
          'The boulder hit a wall and (the boulder) shattered'

    (A.#) ??? ??? ????? ??? ??????? ??? ???
          ???    ???       ?????             ??? ???????                  ???    ???
          DEF.SG hunter(?) PFV:3SG.ABS:stand and PFV:3SG.ABS:kill:3SG.ERG DEF.SG bear
          'The hunter stood up and killed the bear'

In the case where the shared NP is an O in the first clause and an A in the second, it may be deleted if the verb in the second clause is rendered in the antipassive voice, but it is equally possible to just restate the argument.

    (A.#) ??????? ??? ??? ??? ???????
          ???????                  ???      ???    ??? ???????

In this section, I will be following the terminology put forth in Mithun (1984), perhaps the most widely cited work on noun incorporation (NI). In that framework, Ekhwachi would be described as a language that uses both Type I and Type II NI.

I will first describe NI in general and its use in Ekhwachi before describing both types individually. Then, I will explain why I analyze these constructions as NI, since their realization in Ekhwachi is not so prototypical. For the rest of this section, every example that makes use of NI will appear with a corresponding example that does not use NI for clarity.

#### A.B.C. A brief overview of noun incorporation

In NI, a bare noun is compounded with a verb to derive a new lexical item, which is also a verb. Some examples from English would be _babysit_ and _berry-pick_. In Mithin's framework, she categorizes four types of noun incorporation, such that a language with one type of NI should have all types below it. In Ekhwachi, both Type I and Type II are highly productive.

In Type I NI, the noun and verb combine to form a verb of lower valency, which is usually intransitive.

> Such compounding has a significant effect on the role of the N involved. In _He is berry-picking_, the word berry does not refer to a specific _berry_, nor to a particular bushful of berries: it qualifies the V, describing the type of picking in progress.
> (Mithun 1984, p. 849)

Type II NI is essentially similar to Type I, except that the verb retains its original valency. Instead of reducing its valency, another argument fills the void left by the incorporated noun. For example, the possessor of an incorporated P becomes the new P in the clause.

#### A.B.C. Realization of noun incorporation in Ekhwachi

Noun incorporation in Ekhwachi is realized differently than it is in often-cited polysynthetic languages that have it. The incorporated noun stays as an independent word which retains its own stress and is not phonologically attached to the verb in any way.

    ????? ???
    ?????           ???
    PFV:1SG:go.numb leg
    'My leg fell asleep'

    ????? ??? ?????
    ?????           ???    ???
    PFV:3SG:go.numb DEF.SG leg:1SG.POSS
    'My leg fell asleep'

There are restrictions on what nouns may be incorporated. The vast majority of the time, a noun can only be incorporated if it is inanimate as well as originally a P; hypothetical words with meanings like _knife-cut_ or _mainland-go_ are usually ungrammatical, and the few words in the language that incorporate non-P arguments are calqued from other languages. Animate nouns are only incorporated with (?), 'to eat', as well as a small subset of verbs which strongly expect an animate P, such as (?), 'to hunt'.

#### A.B.C. Type I incorporation

In Type I noun incorporation, a P is incorporated into a transitive or intransitive verb, and the resulting verb is intransitive.

    ??? ??? ??????? ???
    ???    ???       ???????          ???
    DEF.SG (bat sp.) PROG:3SG.ABS:eat peach
    'The bat is eating peaches'

    ??? ??? ????????? ??? ???
    ???    ???       ?????????                ??? ???
    DEF.SG (bat sp.) PROG:3PL.ABS:eat:3SG.ERG PL  peach
    'The bat is eating peaches'

The main purpose of Type I NI is to lexicalize an institutionalized or otherwise recognized activity.

    ????? ??? ???
    ?????              ???  ???
    PFV:1PL.EX.ABS:eat rice yesterday
    'We ate rice yesterday'

    ??????? ??? ??? ???
    ???????                    ???    ???  ???
    PFV:3PL.ABS:eat:1PL.EX.ERG DEF.PL rice yesterday
    'We ate rice yesterday'

Since the incorporated noun is no longer indexed on the verb, the number of the incorporated noun becomes ambiguous if it wasn't already.

    ??? ????? ????? ??? ???!
    ???    ?????            ?????             ??? ???
    DEF.SG husband:1SG.POSS PFV:3SG.ABS:break arm yesterday
    'My husband broke his arm(s) yesterday!'

    ??? ????? ??????? ??? ????? ???!
    ???    ?????            ???????                   ???    ?????        ???
    DEF.SG husband:1SG.POSS PFV:3SG.ABS:break:3SG.ERG DEF.SG arm:3SG.POSS yesterday
    'My husband broke his arm yesterday!'

There are not many instances of NI involving originally intransitive verbs, but it occurs customarily with weather verbs.

    ??????? ???
    ???????        ???
    PROG:3SG:shine sun
    'The sun is shining' (lit. 'It's sun-shining')

    ??????? ??? ???
    ???????        ???    ???
    PROG:3SG:shine DEF.SG sun
    'The sun is shining'

    ??????? ???
    ???????              ???
    PROG:3SG:precipitate rain
    'It's raining'

    ??????? ??? ???
    ???????              ???    ???
    PROG:3SG:precipitate DEF.SG rain
    'It's raining', or '(The) rain is falling'

With these verbs and all other instances of Type I NI applied to intransitive verbs, no noun can be used as an S. Their verb agreement prefixes basically index a dummy subject.

#### A.B.C. Type II incorporation

Type II noun incorporation is much like Type I, but another argument is promoted to become a P. The most common use case is incorporating a possessed P in order to realize its possessor as a P. In particular, when something happens to a body part of a living thing, people tend to pay more attention to how the action affected the possessor rather than the body part itself. The promotion of the possessor to the role of P reflects this preference.

    ??? ??? ??????? ???
    ???    ???   ???????                  ???
    DEF.SG tiger PFV:3SG.ABS:bite:3SG.ERG neck
    'The tiger bit its neck'

    ??? ??? ??????? ??? ?????
    ???    ???   ???????                  ???    ?????
    DEF.SG tiger PFV:3SG.ABS:bite:3SG.ERG DEF.SG neck:3SG.POSS
    'The tiger bit its neck'

While the case with body parts is the most prototypical, this application of NI is commonly found for any possessed P.

    ??????? ???
    ???????                   ???
    PFV:2SG.ABS:steal:3PL.ERG spear
    'They stole your spear!'

    ??????? ??? ?????
    ???????                   ???    ?????
    PFV:3SG.ABS:steal:3PL.ERG DEF.SG spear:2SG.POSS
    'They stole your spear!'

Because a benefactive recipient is usually realized as the syntactic possessor of the P, Type II NI often results in what superficially resembles a secundative construction.

    ??????? ???
    ???????                  ???
    PFV:1SG.ABS:give:3SG.ERG axe
    'She gave me an axe'

    ??????? ?????
    ???????                  ?????
    PFV:3SG.ABS:give:3SG.ERG axe:1SG.POSS
    'She gave me an axe'

The use of Type II NI for this kind of possessor-raising is highly productive to the point of being ubiquitous in natural discourse. In practice, NI is only not used this way when the P is unable to be incorporated because it is modified more than minimally, animate, or focused, even though a construction without NI is always grammatical.

    ??????? ??? ??? ???
    ???????                  ???  ???    ???
    PFV:1SG.ABS:hold:3SG.ERG hand DEF.SG child
    'The child held my hand'

    ??????? ??? ????? ??? ???
    ???????                  ???    ?????         ???    ???
    PFV:3SG.ABS:hold:3SG.ERG DEF.SG hand:1SG.POSS DEF.SG child
    'The child held my hand' (odd because (?) is minimally modified)

    ??????? ??? ????? ??? ??? ???
    ???????                  ???    ?????         ???  ???    ???
    PFV:3SG.ABS:hold:3SG.ERG DEF.SG hand:1SG.POSS left DEF.SG child
    'The child held my left hand' (NI unavailable)

    * ??????? ??? ??? ??? ???
      ???????                  ???  ???  ???    ???
      PFV:1SG.ABS:hold:3SG.ERG hand left DEF.SG child
      Intended: 'The child held my left hand'

Additionally, transitive verbs resulting from Type II NI can still undergo valency-reducing operations, including the antipassive and passive voices.

When applied in NI constructions, these voices have the same restrictions as they normally do. For example, relativizing an A requires use of the antipassive voice.

For the rest of this section, relative clauses and their head nouns will be surrounded by square brackets when they appear in glosses containing other words.

Relative clauses in Ekhwachi are placed after the nouns they modify, and they are separated by the relativizer (?). When the head noun is the patient of the verb in the relative clause, it is only expressed with verb agreement.

    (A.#) ??? ??? ???????
          ???  ??? ???????
          tree REL PROG:3SG.ABS:fall
          'a tree that is falling'

    (A.#) ??? ??? ??? ???????
          ???    ???  ??? ???????
          DEF.SG girl REL PFV:3SG.ABS:praise:1PL.EX.ERG
          'the girl that we praised'

    (A.#) ??? ??? ??? ?????????
          ???    ??? ??? ?????????
          DEF.SG man REL PROG:3SG.ABS:carrying:2PL.ERG
          'the man that you're carrying'

Agents cannot be directly relativized. In order to relativize an agent, it must first be promoted to the role of subject by rendering the verb in the antipassive voice. The object, which is no longer indexed on the verb, can optionally be expressed as an oblique argument.

    (A.#) ??? ??? ??? ??????? (??? ???)
          ???    ???  ??? ???????               (???  ???)
          DEF.SG girl REL PFV:3SG.ABS:praise:AP (with 1PL.EX)
          'the girl who praised (us)'

    (A.#) ??? ??? ??? ????????? (??? ???)
          ???    ??? ??? ?????????             (???  ???)
          DEF.SG man REL PROG:3SG.ABS:carry:AP (with 2PL)
          'the man who is carrying (you)'

When the head noun is of any other role, such as the destination of a verb of motion, an indirect object, or an instrument, the head noun is explicitly expressed in the relative clause by a resumptive pronoun that is inserted in situ, or in the case of a relativized genitive, realized as a possessive suffix.

    (A.#) ??? ??? ????? ??? ???
          ???   ??? ?????          ??? ???
          field REL PFV:1SG.ABS:go LOC yon
          'a field that I went to'

    (A.#) ??? ??? ????????? ????? ??? ???
          ???   ??? ?????????           ?????           ???  ???
          spear REL 3SG.ABS:hunt:HAB:AP sister:2SG.POSS with that
          'a spear that one of your sisters hunts with'

    (A.#) ??? ??? ??? ??????? ??? ?????
          ???    ???    ??? ???????                    ???    ???   -??
          DEF.SG boy(?) REL PFV:1PL.IN.ABS:invite:AS3G DEF.SG father-3SG.POSS
          'the boy whose father invited us'

### <a name="relative_clauses_shifting"></a>A.B. Relative clauses and shifting <a href="#table_of_contents">^</a>

NPs containing relative clauses often influence the order in which constituents appear, owing to the fact that they tend to be comparatively long and/or complex. For brevity, we will call such NPs "heavy". It is generally dispreferred that any arguments or adjuncts occur after especially heavy NPs, so they tend to appear earlier in the phrase than is typical when they co-occur.

The examples below demonstrate this principle. The basic, unmarked order of constituents in a clause containing a transitive verb and an adjunct is verb-object-agent-adjunct.

    (A.#) ??????? ??? ????? ??? ??? ??? ???
          ???????                  ???    ?????         ???    ??? ???    ???
          PFV:3SG.ABS:push:3PL.ERG DEF.SG boat:3PL.POSS DEF.PL man LOC(?) river
          'The men pushed their boat into a river'

The agent may be fronted and precede the verb without any additional marking due to being topicalized, and the adjunct may occur in any position between phrases, but the example above gives the most pragmatically neutral word order. When the NP involving the boat is made heavier by modifying it with an adjective and a relative clause, it causes the verb to be in the antipassive voice to facilitate fronting of the agent, though the adjunct is only somewhat more likely to precede the heavy NP than before.

    (A.#) ??????? ??? ??? ??? ??? ????? ??? ??? ??????? ??? ???
          ???????             ???    ??? ???  [???    ?????         ??? ??? ???????]                 ???    ???
          PFV:3PL.ABS:push:AP DEF.PL man with [DEF.SG boat:3PL.POSS new REL PFV:3SG.ABS:buy:3PL.ERG] LOC(?) river
          'The men pushed their new boat that they bought into a river'

When the relative clause above is especially heavy, containing adjuncts or its own relative clauses, the adjunct is also fronted and appears before it.

    (A.#) ??????? ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ????? ??? ??? ??????? ??? ??? ??? ??? ?????????
          ???????             ???    ??? ???    ???   ???  [???    ?????         ??? ??? ???????                 ???    [???    ???  ??? ?????????]]
          PFV:3PL.ABS:push:AP DEF.PL man LOC(?) river with [DEF.PL boat:3PL.POSS new REL PFV:3SG.ABS:buy:3PL.ERG LOC(?) [DEF.SG town REL 3SG.ABS:visit:HAB:3PL.ERG]]
          'The men pushed into a river their new boat that they bought in the town that they often visit'

While the above examples happen to show this with a transitive verb, the same reordering can also be observed whenever any verb is followed by two or more overt arguments or adjuncts.

The kinship terminology of Ekhwachi reflects a cultural practice of grouping families by matrilineal descent groups, following basically an Iroquois system. The abbreviations used for relationship terms in this section are the standard ones used when discussing kinship terminology, but they are listed below for convenience.

| Term   | Symbol | Term     | Symbol |
| ------ | ------ | -------- | ------ |
| mother | M      | sister   | Z      |
| father | F      | brother  | B      |
| parent | P      | daughter | D      |
| child  | C      | son      | S      |

Figure A. _Abbreviations used for kinship terms in this section._

The charts on the next two pages compare the kin terms used in Ekhwachi to their corresponding terms in English. The terms are grouped by the following list of priorities, with priorities higher on the list outranking those below them.

1. Members of the same generation are grouped together
2. Terms for members of ego's clan come before non-members
3. Terms for female relatives come before terms for male relatives
4. Terms for closer relatives come before more distant relatives
